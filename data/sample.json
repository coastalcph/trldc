{"text": "11.  at the beginning of the events relevant to the application, k. had a daughter, p., and a son, m., born in 1986 and 1988 respectively. p.\u2019s father is x and m.\u2019s father is v. from march to may 1989 k. was voluntarily hospitalised for about three months, having been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. from august to november 1989 and from december 1989 to march 1990, she was again hospitalised for periods of about three months on account of this illness. in 1991 she was hospitalised for less than a week, diagnosed as suffering from an atypical and undefinable psychosis. it appears that social welfare and health authorities have been in contact with the family since 1989. 12.  the applicants initially cohabited from the summer of 1991 to july 1993. in 1991 both p. and m. were living with them. from 1991 to 1993 k. and x were involved in a custody and access dispute concerning p. in may 1992 a residence order was made transferring custody of p. to x. 13.  k. was again hospitalised from 22 april to 7 may 1992, from 13 may to 10 june 1992, and from 11 to 17 january 1993, on account of psychoses. she was in compulsory care between 15 may and 10 june 1992. according to a medical report dated 15 may 1992, k. was paranoid and psychotic. 14.  on 19 march 1993, according to the social welfare authorities\u2019 records, a discussion took place between a social worker and k.\u2019s mother. k.\u2019s mother said that her daughter\u2019s health condition was really bad and that k. had destroyed a childhood picture of hers, a wedding photo of the mother, broken a glass and \u201cpierced the eyes\u201d of all appearing in the photos. k.\u2019s mother had said that she was tired of the situation, as she did not get any support from the mental health authorities. she added that she was worried and afraid that \u201cagain something must happen before k. is admitted to care\u201d.\non 24 march 1993 k. was placed under observation with a view to determining whether she should be placed in compulsory psychiatric care, having initially been diagnosed as suffering from psychosis. the conditions for compulsory care were not considered to be met but she remained in voluntary care until 5 may 1993. 15.  allegedly, x did not allow k., p. and m. to meet. on 11 may 1993, when k. was again pregnant, her access to p. was further limited by an order of the district court of r. basing itself on a doctor\u2019s opinion, the court held that the child\u2019s mental development would be endangered if the meetings between p. and k. continued without supervision as had been ordered in 1992. 16.  according to the records of the social welfare authorities, m. showed signs of behavioural problems. on 30 march 1992 a psychologist reported how m. had played with two dolls saying \u2013 in very vulgar terms \u2013 that they were performing sexual acts. on 17 february 1993 k. was said to have broken a mirror in the presence of m. who had kept repeating: \u201cmummy broke the mirror ...\u201d\nnotes of the social authorities of 24 and 30 march 1993 among others state that games which m. played and pictures he drew were of a destructive nature. according to the notes taken on 30 march, he had lately, while the children were singing together at the day-care nursery, shown immense hatred, threatening \u201cto kill everybody\u201d. the occasions when k. fetched him were described as \u201cunpleasant scenes\u201d, m. shouting and hitting his mother who did not react. it was noted, however, that he no longer played doll games with sexual connotations. 17.  according to the records of the social welfare authorities, a discussion between k., her mother, t. and a number of social and mental-health care officials took place on 31 march 1993, during which it was mentioned that the authorities might have to intervene in m.\u2019s upbringing, from the child-protection point of view, in a more drastic way than had been the case so far. it appeared that in connection with k.\u2019s recent hospitalisation t. had \u201cforcibly\u201d taken her from a restaurant, which had made k. furious, with the consequence that she had thrown things around; for example, the microwave oven had ended up on the floor. t. had said that k. was unable to control herself. 18.  on the following day the child welfare support group, consisting of various social and health authorities, agreed that the aim should be to place m. in a children\u2019s home for three months as an assistance measure of open care under section 14 of the 1983 child welfare act (lastensuojelulaki, barnskyddslag 683/1983 \u2013 \u201cthe 1983 act\u201d), during which period psychological examinations of the child would be carried out. 19.  on 3 may 1993 a social welfare official decided on behalf of the social welfare board (perusturvalautakunta, grundtrygghetsn\u00e4mnden) of s. to place m. in a children\u2019s home for a period of three months. this was to be regarded as a short-term support measure pursuant to the 1983 act. the applicants had been consulted, together with k.\u2019s mother and sister, on 8 april 1993, in order to find an open-care measure which would be practicable. according to the records of that meeting, no such practical measure had been proposed by any of the participants. the applicants had then been heard again on 21 april 1993 and had not objected to the placing of m. in a children\u2019s home. 20.  in an opinion of 12 may 1993, requested by the social welfare board, doctors m.l. and k.r. considered that k. was not at that time able to care for m., but that her mental state would not necessarily permanently prevent her from caring for him. doctors m.l. and k.r. worked at the hospital of h., where k. had been cared for since 1991 during the periods indicated above. 21.  on 7 june 1993 it was reported by the social welfare authorities that, when k. and t. had come to the children\u2019s home where m. was staying, the boy had undergone a total change in his behaviour, characterised by anger, hatred, swearing, etc. t. had said that he was really tired of the situation and that in his view k. was in need of hospitalisation. when a visit to the health centre had been suggested to her, she had become very angry.\naccording to a statement of 22 june 1993 by the children\u2019s home, k. and t. had come to the home on 17 june 1993. while t. had been playing with m., other children had come to tell the staff that k. had asked a 3-year-old girl what her name was. as the girl did not reply, k. had raised her voice and shaken the girl, not letting her go until an older girl had given the child\u2019s name. the other children had been frightened by k.\u2019s behaviour. 22.  on 11 june 1993 the social welfare official who had decided on 3 may 1993 to place m. in a children\u2019s home informed the university hospital of t. and the local hospital of s. in writing that she was very worried about the health of k. and the baby she was carrying. she requested the hospitals to contact her as soon as k. arrived at the hospital and, more particularly, at the time of the baby\u2019s delivery. she also expressed the wish that health-care professionals should pay special attention to the relationship between the mother and the new-born baby from the very beginning. 23.  on 18 june 1993 k. was taken to a district hospital, where she gave birth to j. on the same day. according to the hospital records, the mother stayed calm during the delivery. after the delivery a written decision concerning an emergency care order was served on the hospital. the child was taken to the children\u2019s ward. the mother\u2019s behaviour in the ward was later found to be somewhat restless but not completely disorderly. the hospital records indicate that she understood the situation and wanted to leave hospital the following day. medication to prevent the secretion of milk was prescribed. it seems that k. left the hospital on 19 june 1993, that is, the following morning, without any post-natal examination. she went to her mother\u2019s home, where she started pushing an empty pram around the place. 24.  j. was immediately placed in emergency care, pursuant to section 18 of the 1983 act. after the birth of their child, k. and t. were informed of this decision by two social workers at the hospital of h. the social director, who had made the decision on behalf of the social welfare board, noted that k.\u2019s mental state had been unstable during the last stages of her pregnancy. he considered that the baby\u2019s health would be endangered since k. had found out about the plans to place the baby in public care. lastly, he considered that the baby\u2019s father, t., could not guarantee its development and safety. in addition the social director referred to the family\u2019s long-standing difficulties, namely, k.\u2019s serious illness and occasionally uncontrolled emotional reactions which could be traumatic for the children, t.\u2019s inability to care for both j. and k., k.\u2019s reluctance to accept guidance, the impossibility of putting the whole responsibility for j.\u2019s development on t., and the impossibility of providing open-care support measures to the necessary extent. the applicants were not heard prior to the decision. on 24 june 1993 the applicants were notified in writing of the decision to take the new-born baby into public care. the notification was also faxed to k. 25.  on 21 june 1993 the social director also placed m. in emergency care, citing principally the same reasons as in his decision of 18 june 1993 concerning j. 26.  the applicants did not appeal against the emergency care orders. 27.  on 21 june 1993 the social welfare board took note of the emergency care orders and prohibited all unsupervised access between k. on the one hand, and j. and m. on the other. the number of supervised visits, however, was not restricted. the board decided to continue preparations for taking m. and j. into care. 28.  a meeting was held by social workers at the family centre on 21 june 1993, before the arrival of the baby from the hospital and in the absence of the applicants. it is mentioned in the report that there was a plan to prohibit the mother\u2019s visits for a month on the ground that her reactions could not be predicted as she had, for example, broken things at home. after this initial period she would be allowed to visit the baby without restriction, but accompanied by her personal nurse. however, this plan was not implemented. the following entry appears in the register for 24 june: \u201cthe mother may come with her personal nurse if she wants. other visitors not allowed for the time being.\u201d 29.  k. was asked to come with t. to the social welfare office on 22 june 1993 at 11.30 a.m. in order to be informed of the decision of 21 june 1993 by the social director concerning m. on 24 june 1993 k. and v. (m.\u2019s biological father) were notified in writing of the decision of 21 june 1993. the notification was also faxed to k. 30.  on 22 june 1993 k. was hospitalised voluntarily at the hospital of h. on account of psychosis, having obtained a referral from a doctor at a health care centre. she was treated there until 30 june 1993. 31.  on 23 june 1993 j. was placed in the family centre. t. visited her the same day. 32.  at the beginning of july 1993 t. left the applicants\u2019 home, having been told by the social welfare officials that he had to break off his relationship with k. \u201cif he wanted to keep\u201d j. the applicants nevertheless continued their relationship. 33.  on 15 july 1993 the social welfare board gave its decisions taking j. and m. into \u201cnormal\u201d public care, giving reasons similar to those mentioned in the emergency care orders (see paragraph 24 above), and prolonged the access restriction until 15 september 1993. k. was allowed to see the children only in the company of her personal nurse. the board essentially considered that k.\u2019s state of health remained unstable; that she was subject to aggressive and uncontrolled emotional moods; and that public care proceedings were a severe mental ordeal for a patient. as regards j., the board therefore believed that her personal security could be jeopardised if access were to take place without supervision. as regards m., the board feared that k.\u2019s visits to the children\u2019s home \u201ccould no longer be supervised by its staff, which would not be in his interest\u201d. before the decisions of 15 july 1993 the applicants had been heard and had expressed their objection to the care decisions envisaged. 34.  on 15 july 1993 k. visited both her children, accompanied by her personal nurse. the register indicates that it was \u201ca difficult situation\u201d. 35.  on 19 july 1993 t. moved to the family unit of the family centre with j. 36.  on 20 july 1993 k. was again hospitalised in voluntary care at the open ward of the hospital of h., suffering from psychosis. she left hospital the following day, however. on 26 july 1993 she was placed under observation with a view to determining whether she should be placed in compulsory psychiatric care. on 30 july 1993 she was committed to compulsory psychiatric care. according to the file, her relatives had earlier been worried about her and had contacted the hospital in order to get her into hospital care. they reported that k. had disappeared from her home, where she had behaved in an unsettled and aggressive manner. her hospitalisation lasted until 27 october 1993, that is, three months. 37.  during the period between 18 june and 31 august 1993 k. visited her children at their respective children\u2019s homes. during the visits she was accompanied by her personal nurse from the hospital, who was in contact with the social welfare authorities and arranged the visits having regard to k.\u2019s state of mental health. according to the centre\u2019s register, she visited j. twice during this period. 38.  according to a statement made by a social worker on 4 august 1993, t. had taken good care of j., first at the hospital until 23 june 1993 and later on at the family centre. it was agreed that j. would stay at the family centre and that t. would visit her every other day. j. would visit her father for the first time from 13 to 15 august 1993, during which time t. would organise her christening. the intention was that the baby could move in with her father later on. 39.  after t.\u2019s paternity had been established on 13 july 1993, t. and k. were granted joint custody of j. on 4 august 1993. 40.  t.\u2019s travel expenses to the centre were paid for by the social welfare authorities. from the centre\u2019s records it can be deduced that t. succeeded in creating a relationship with the baby and learned to take good care of her. the home leaves were spent with t. first at his mother\u2019s house and later in his new home. 41.  on 12 august 1993 the social welfare board referred both public care orders to the county administrative court (l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus, l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten) for confirmation, as the applicants had opposed them. in support of its referrals, the board submitted a statement by a social welfare official dated 25 august 1993, according to which t. would not be able to care both for m. and the new-born j. alone, since k. was living in the same home and had been psychotic for the last four years. t. had been in contact with j. at the children\u2019s home three to four times a week. while staying in a flat attached to a municipal children\u2019s home, he had cared for j. for two whole weeks and had subsequently cared for her three days a week in his new home. the board had therefore begun investigating whether it would be possible to entrust him with the responsibility for j. with the help of support measures taken by the board. 42.  on 9 september 1993 the county administrative court confirmed the care order concerning j., considering that k. had been mentally ill; that the applicants had had conflicts \u201cas a result of which t. had moved away from their home at the beginning of july 1993\u201d; that because of k.\u2019s illness and the family\u2019s other problems the applicants had been unable to provide j. with adequate care; that the care support provided to the family had not sufficiently improved the family\u2019s situation and that the measures could not be expected to satisfy j.\u2019s care needs. no hearing was held. 43.  on 11 november 1993 the county administrative court confirmed the care order concerning m., repeating the reasons put forward in its decision of 9 september concerning j. no hearing was held. 44.  in an appeal to the supreme administrative court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen) against the confirmation of the public care order concerning m., the applicants were represented by the public legal adviser (yleinen oikeusavustaja, allm\u00e4nna r\u00e4ttsbitr\u00e4det) of s. the supreme administrative court dismissed the appeal on 23 september 1994. 45.  on the same date the supreme administrative court extended the time allowed for an appeal by k. against the confirmation of the care order made in respect of j. 46.  on 18 october 1994 k. appealed against the care order in respect of j. as confirmed by the county administrative court on 9 september 1993. on 21 august 1995 the supreme administrative court granted k. cost-free proceedings as from 1 march 1994, appointed ms suomela as her representative and upheld the county administrative court\u2019s decision of 9 september 1993. 47.  by a decision of 21 january 1994 the social welfare board placed j. in a foster home in k., a town some 120 km away from the applicants\u2019 home. m. joined her on 7 february 1994. the foster parents had no children of their own. social welfare officials told the applicants and the foster parents that j.\u2019s and m.\u2019s placement would last \u201cfor years\u201d. the applicants had proposed that the children\u2019s public care be implemented in the homes of relatives. 48.  in the meantime, on 15 august 1993, j. was christened in the presence of k., t. and m. 49.  a consultation was held at the children\u2019s home, on 18 august 1993, in the presence of t. according to the records, k.\u2019s mental health was very unstable and her psychiatric treatment was expected to have to be continued for four to five years. t., however, had expressed his hopes that k. and he could, together, take care of j. in the future. it was agreed that j. would stay at the children\u2019s home and would visit t. every week from thursday until saturday, beginning on 28 august 1993. t. would visit j. on other days, according to an arrangement to be agreed with the children\u2019s home. 50.  on 14 september 1993 the social welfare board prolonged the access restriction until 15 december 1993. 51.  the following notes of a social welfare official appear among those in the case records of the social welfare board:\n\u201c14 september 1993:\n\u2026 2.  ... in addition, the importance of future access between j. and t. has now been questioned, since j.\u2019s placement in [public foster care] is under preparation. it will be difficult for t. to give up j. ...\u201d\n\u201c13 october 1993: 52.  on 27 october 1993 k. was discharged from the hospital of h. 53.  on 2 february 1994 the social welfare board drew up a plan concerning the implementation of the public care. the applicants\u2019 alternative plan was allegedly ignored. for instance, the children could not meet their maternal grandmother at her home. 54.  after the adoption of the care plan on 2 february 1994, the applicants requested a relaxation of the access restriction. for example, t. had been permitted to see j. only once a month. 55.  on 21 march 1994 the applicants requested, inter alia, that the social welfare board should draw up a public care plan aiming at the reunification of the family. 56.  on 3 may 1994 the social welfare authorities organised a meeting in order to revise the care plan of 2 february 1994. the applicants and their representative did not attend the meeting. 57.  on 17 may 1994 the social director restricted both applicants\u2019 access to the children to one monthly visit at the foster home, to take place under supervision and last three hours. the social director considered that the grounds for public care still existed. in his view, although the applicants were dissatisfied with the visits set out in the care plan, affording the children an unlimited right to see their parents would create an obstacle to their successful placement. the applicants appealed. 58.  on 28 september 1994 the county administrative court held an oral hearing concerning the access restriction imposed on 17 may 1994. it took evidence from two psychiatrists, who had interviewed k. one of them, dr t.i.-e., did not know k. personally but commented on a diagnosis concerning her mental state by indicating that k. had a tendency to react in a psychotic manner to conflict situations. dr k.p. stated that k.\u2019s state of health did not prevent her from caring for her children. consequently, if her illness had been the reason for the access restriction, that reason no longer existed. 59.  in a written expert opinion, requested by the social welfare board and submitted to the county administrative court, dr e.v., a child psychiatrist, expressed the opinion that the children should be permanently cared for by the foster parents and that the applicants\u2019 visits should, for the time being, be discontinued so as to protect the children and the foster parents. according to the applicants, dr e.v. had not met them or the children, nor had he consulted the other psychiatrists before making his proposal. 60.  on 11 october 1994 the county administrative court upheld the access restriction issued on 17 may 1994. it noted that neither of the witnesses who had been heard orally had been willing to state any opinion as regards the children\u2019s development. it reasoned, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201c... [by allowing] access to take place once a month and [by allowing contact through correspondence] it will be ensured that the children will retain knowledge about their biological parents. if the grounds for public care later cease to exist, a reunification of the family will thus be possible. ...\u201d 61.  the county administrative court dismissed the applicants\u2019 request for exemption from costs, since the relevant legislation did not cover disputes concerning access restrictions. at the court\u2019s hearing, the applicants were nevertheless assisted by ms suomela. 62.  on 26 may 1994 the applicants requested that the social welfare board discontinue the public care of m. and j. 63.  on 18 september 1994 the social director allegedly told the applicants that any further children born to them would also be placed in public care. according to the government, the social director only told them, when expressly asked, that it was possible that any further children born would be taken into public care. 64.  in an opinion of 22 september 1994 submitted at the social welfare board\u2019s request, dr k.p., a psychiatrist, commented on the possibility of revoking the public care orders. she concluded that k.\u2019s mental state would not prevent her from having custody of the children. according to dr k.p., k.\u2019s efforts to have public care discontinued and access restrictions relaxed showed that she possessed psychological resources. she noted, inter alia, that t. was k.\u2019s closest support in the care and upbringing of the children. in addition, k.\u2019s mother, at the time her guardian ad litem, was ready to help in caring for them. dr k.p., however, added that she could not, as a psychiatrist for adults, take any stand as regards the interests of the children. dr k.p.\u2019s opinion was also based on a report submitted by dr k.po., a psychologist, who had come to the same conclusion as regards k.\u2019s ability to have custody of her children. 65.  the public legal adviser advised against requesting revocation of the care orders. 66.  k. was hospitalised from 15 to 24 february and from 11 april to 29 may 1995, apparently on account of psychosis. 67.  on 14 march 1995 the social welfare board rejected the applicants\u2019 request of 26 may 1994 that the care order be revoked, stating as follows:\n\u201cat the moment the health of the children\u2019s mother, k., is better and the family situation has changed in other respects in comparison with the situation in 1993 when the decisions to take the children into care were made.\n...\naccording to dr k.p., a psychiatrist, k. still has \u2018a lot of instability\u2019 in her emotional life as well as fragility, brought about by the last five years\u2019 experiences and the diagnosis of mental illness for which she needs \u2013 and will need for a long time to come \u2013 therapeutic support and treatment. a regular medication is also needed in order to guarantee her continued well-being and to make it possible for her to manage in open care and to have custody of her children. dr k.p., however, did not give her more precise opinion as to k.\u2019s ability to take care of and bring up her children even though dr k.p. was explicitly asked to give such an opinion. 68.  the applicants appealed on 5 april 1995, requesting that they be granted exemption from costs and afforded free legal representation. they also requested an oral hearing. 69.  on 7 april 1995 a further child, r., was born to the applicants. having given birth, k. left the hospital for a while on the same evening with the new-born baby wrapped in a blanket, walking barefoot in the cold weather until the hospital staff realised what had happened and intervened. 70.  on 13 april 1995 k. was committed to compulsory psychiatric care and treated at the hospital of h. until 29 may 1995, while r. was being cared for by t. according to a psychiatrist\u2019s observation of 10 april 1995, k. \u201cmust have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia for some time\u201d. 71.  on 15 june 1995 the county administrative court granted the applicants exemption from costs and appointed ms suomela as their representative in the case concerning their appeal against the social welfare board\u2019s decision of 14 march 1995. it decided not to hold a hearing in respect of the applicants\u2019 request for a revocation of the care orders and provided the parties with an opportunity to supplement their written observations. 72.  on 28 september 1995 the county administrative court rejected the applicants\u2019 appeals of 5 april 1995 without holding an oral hearing. the court noted, inter alia, that according to the medical certificates, k.\u2019s state of health had improved but her emotional life was still unstable. she therefore continued to be in need of psychotherapy and medication. in addition, a further child had been born to the applicants and k. had again been treated at the hospital of h. these two factors had caused an additional strain militating against a revocation of the care orders. 73.  on 17 november 1994 social welfare officials revised the public care plan, proposing that the children meet the applicants once a month on neutral premises at the family advice centre of k., where the foster parents were living. the applicants objected to this proposal, considering that it would have entailed a further restriction of their access to the children. instead, they requested two meetings a month, one of which was to be at their place of residence. on 22 december 1994 they asked for a separate written decision concerning their access request, so that they could appeal against it. 74.  in a letter of 22 december 1994 the social director informed the applicants that there were no longer any grounds for the access restriction. meetings between the applicants and the children were nevertheless only authorised for three hours once a month on premises chosen by the social welfare board. they were also informed that the meetings would be supervised. 75.  in his decision of 11 january 1995 the social director confirmed that there were no longer any grounds for the access restriction. on 31 january and 28 february 1995 the social welfare board confirmed the decision of 11 january 1995. the applicants appealed. 76.  as regards the applicants\u2019 appeal against the social welfare board\u2019s decisions of 31 january and 28 february 1995, the county administrative court considered, on 15 june 1995, that the revised care plan drawn up on 17 november 1994 had already entailed an access restriction which had later been renewed by further decisions, without the applicants having been properly heard, in respect of their access request. the matter was referred back to the social welfare board for further consideration. 77.  in the light of the county administrative court\u2019s decision the acting social director, on 28 june 1995, formally restricted the applicants\u2019 access to the children to one meeting a month up to 31 may 1996. the meetings were to take place in the foster home. in addition, the foster parents were to visit the applicants with the children every six months. the director considered, inter alia, that it was important that the children settle themselves in the foster family environment in which they would grow up. closer contacts with their parents would mean change and insecurity as well as the creation of a new crisis in their development. the process of settling which had started well would be jeopardised. for the children\u2019s progress it was therefore necessary that their situation remain stable and secure. the director\u2019s decision was confirmed by the social welfare board on 22 august 1995. the applicants appealed. 78.  on 3 november 1995 the county administrative court rejected the applicants\u2019 appeal against the access restriction confirmed on 22 august 1995. 79.  on 25 may 1996 social welfare officials revised the public care plan, proposing that the children meet the applicants once a month on the premises of a school at the children\u2019s place of residence. as the applicants were not present when the proposal was made, the care plan was again revised on 9 october 1996 in so far as the access restriction was concerned. the applicants then proposed that the children meet them without supervision once a month. the public care plan was, however, revised as proposed by the social welfare officials. 80.  on 17 june 1996 the social director restricted both applicants\u2019 access to the children, until 30 november 1997, to one monthly visit on the premises of a school at the children\u2019s place of residence, where access was to take place under supervision for three hours. one of the foster parents was also ordered to be present at the time of the access. the social director\u2019s decision was confirmed by the social welfare board on 20 august 1996. the applicants\u2019 appealed against the decision to the county administrative court, requesting an oral hearing. the court obtained a statement from a child psychiatrist, dr j.p., who was also recommended by the applicants\u2019 representative to the social welfare board. dr j.p.\u2019s statement included the following observations:\n\u201cthe right of access of m. and j. to the persons close to them must primarily be examined in the light of their psychological growth and development and their health. this requires an examination of the quality, permanence and durability of their human relationships, because psychological growth and development take place in interaction with human relationships. in my opinion, the human relationships are to be examined from the children\u2019s point of view. ...\n... in conclusion, i note that before m. was placed in the children\u2019s home ... the mother had been in psychiatric hospital for treatment eight times, making a total of thirteen months. thus, m. had lived with his mother for forty-five months, namely, three years and nine months. the longest that they spent together was two years and one month. ... t. has, as \u2018stepfather\u2019, helped to look after m. for at most ten months. ... the foster parents have so far looked after m. for three years and three months without interruption. ... in practice, m. has not had any kind of relationship with his biological father ... \nin the light of the above, i note that the human relationships in m.\u2019s early childhood have, owing to the circumstances, been non-continuous, short-term and changing. the most stable and continuous relationships have been with his foster parents ... therefore, these relationships are the most relevant and important ones for m.\u2019s psychological growth and development.\n... j. was born in june 1993. she was taken into public care immediately after she was born. at first, she stayed in the district hospital for a short time, and later at a reception home for small children. t., as the biological father of j., looked after her for two weeks in june and august 1993. j. was placed in the foster family ... in january 1994, when she was some seven months old. so far, j. has stayed with her foster family for some three years and three months without interruption. j. is now a little over 3 years and 10 months old.\nin the light of the above, i note that, due to the circumstances, j. has not had any significant and important relationships other than those with her foster parents. j.\u2019s relationship with her foster parents is of primary importance for her psychological growth and development. ...\n... from the children\u2019s point of view, especially, but naturally also from that of the foster parents, the foster family is a family to which the principles concerning family life enshrined in the united nations convention on the rights of the child and in the european convention on human rights can be applied in the same way as to biological families. this point of view is especially important when, due to the circumstances, the biological family has not lived together.\nin the light of the above, i note that the arrangements for helping and supporting the foster parents of m. and j. are in the best interests of the children. the arrangement will, in the first place, ensure the important, continuous and safe human relationships of m. and j. with their foster parents ...\nit is also important for m. and j.\u2019s psychological growth and development that, in the safe and stable conditions provided by the foster family, they are able to form and maintain a good internalised picture of their biological parents ... from whom they have been separated because of the circumstances.\nin my opinion, this can be done by complying with the decision of the social welfare board of s. of 20 august 1996 concerning the right of access. at present, an unrestricted right of access or a right of access of the extent suggested by the applicants is not in the interests of the children, because k. and t. are not capable of meeting the emotional needs of m. and j. ... such arrangements concerning the right of access would clearly endanger the health and development of m. and j. in my opinion, the question of an unrestricted right of access should be evaluated when the children have attained the age of 12.\u201d 81.  in a statement of 10 september 1996 dr k.p. stated that in her opinion k.\u2019s psychiatric state did not preclude k.\u2019s having custody of her daughter r. 82.  on 2 april 1997 the care plan was again revised by the social welfare authorities. the applicants had been informed of the time of the meeting concerning the revision of this care plan on home visits on 15 january and 10 march 1997. their representative had also been informed of the meeting by a letter sent on 10 february 1997. the applicants did not attend the meeting, and neither did their representative. the applicants were thus not explicitly heard in this connection but, as they had expressed their opinion on other occasions, the authorities recorded their point of view in the plan. 83.  on 12 june 1997 the county administrative court rejected the applicants\u2019 appeal against the social welfare board\u2019s decision of 20 august 1996 to restrict the applicants\u2019 access right (see paragraph 80 above). it refused the applicants\u2019 request for an oral hearing. 84.  although the applicants had stated only in their reply that the appeal was also made on r.\u2019s behalf, the county administrative court found in its decision that it was in part made in her name. the court stated that a person to whom a decision was directed, or upon whose right, duty or interest it had a direct effect, had the right of appeal. the court considered that the board\u2019s decision, which concerned r.\u2019s siblings\u2019 and parents\u2019 right of access, was not such a decision. 85.  on 28 november 1997 the social director restricted the applicants\u2019, and consequently their youngest child r.\u2019s, access to j. and m. to one monthly visit of three hours on the premises of a school at the children\u2019s place of residence until the end of 1998. the applicants did not appeal. 86.  the care plan was again revised on 1 december 1998. 87.  according to a statement made on 3 july 1998 by dr k.m. (formerly dr k.p.), k. had not been hospitalised since may 1995 and her health had been stable since the beginning of 1995. there had been no problems concerning the care of r. (who had lived with her parents all the time and had not been taken into care). it was recommended by dr k.m. that the social welfare authorities should reduce or discontinue control visits to the applicants\u2019 home in order to give k. the possibility of settling down to normal life without constant supervision by the authorities. 88.  the restriction orders were extended by the social director on 11 december 1998, until the end of 2000. the visits were to take place under supervision on the premises of a school at the children\u2019s place of residence. however, one of the visits was to take place at the applicants\u2019 home in the presence of the foster parents. the social director considered, inter alia, that the reunification of the family was not in sight as the foster family was now the children\u2019s de facto home; that the applicants\u2019 access to the children once a month and through correspondence was enough to maintain the children\u2019s awareness of their biological parents; and that closer contacts with the applicants would endanger the children\u2019s development, bring change and insecurity and create a new crisis in their development. the applicants appealed against this decision to the social welfare board which, on 2 february 1999, rejected the appeal and upheld the social director\u2019s decisions. in its reasoning, the board quoted both the county administrative court and dr j.p. 89.  according to the reports drawn up by the supervisor who attended the meetings of the children and the applicants during the period from 25 may 1996 to 10 january 1999, the adults got on quite well together during the meetings. j. often played games with m. when r. was smaller, j. played by herself, but later it seemed that the girls, j. and r., spent more time together. on the other hand, it seemed that the first applicant made very little contact with j. and m. according to the supervisor\u2019s description, especially in the earlier reports, the first applicant seemed to have concentrated on r. 90.  m. visited k. and t. at their home for the weekend of 21 to 23 july 2000 without supervision. 91.  the applicants appealed against the social welfare board\u2019s decision of 2 february 1999, concerning the right of access, to the administrative court (formerly the county administrative court). an oral hearing, at which m. was also heard, was held on 3 october 2000. in its decision of 13 october 2000 the administrative court upheld the social welfare board\u2019s decision. 92.  the social authorities reviewed the care plan on 23 november 2000, having consulted the applicants, among others. it was decided that the children would remain in the foster home. according to the care plan, m. and j. are allowed to meet k. and t and others close to them, as from 1 january 2001 until 31 december 2001, without supervision once a month alternately at the applicants\u2019 home and the foster parents\u2019 home. the meetings at the applicants\u2019 home will take place from saturday 11 a.m. until sunday 4 p.m., and the meetings at the foster parents\u2019 home on sundays, from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. the children are also allowed to meet their other relatives freely during those meetings. in addition to the above, the children will also spend a day and a night with the applicants each christmas, and two weeks each summer during their school holidays. 93.  j. and m.\u2019s foster mother died in may 2001.", "labels": ["8"]}
{"text": "9.  the applicant is the monarch of liechtenstein, born in 1945 and living in vaduz (liechtenstein). 10.  the applicant\u2019s late father, the former monarch of liechtenstein, had been the owner of the painting szene an einem r\u00f6mischen kalkofen (alias der gro\u00dfe kalkofen) of pieter van laer, which had formed part of his family\u2019s art collection since at least 1767. until the end of the second world war the painting had been in one of the family\u2019s castles on the territory of the now czech republic. 11.  in 1946 the former czechoslovakia confiscated the property of the applicant\u2019s father which was situated in its territory, including the painting in question, under decree no. 12 on the \u201cconfiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of german and hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the czech and slovak people\u201d (dekretu prezidenta republiky \u010d. 12/1945 sb. o konfiskaci a urychlen\u00e9m rozd\u011blen\u00ed majetku n\u011bmc\u016f, mad\u2019ar\u016f, zr\u00e1dc\u016f a nep\u0159\u00e1tel), issued by the president of the former czechoslovakia on 21 june 1945 (\u201cthe bene\u0161 decrees\u201d \u2013 \u201cbene\u0161ovy dekrety\u201d). 12.  on 21 november 1951 the bratislava administrative court (spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud) dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant\u2019s father. \nin its reasoning on the merits of the case, the administrative court stated that the defendant office had come to the conclusion that the appellant was a person of german nationality within the meaning of the provision in article 1 \u00a7 1 (a) of the decree, on the basis of a finding that this was and had been generally known. it noted that the defence of the complaint directed against this finding was restricted to the representation that this finding was not supported in the files and that, due to this shortcoming, it had not been necessary to deal with the finding in greater detail. the administrative court considered that this approach was mistaken as, under the relevant provision of the administrative regulations, no evidence was required for facts which were generally known and, therefore, it was not necessary for evidence to be contained in the administrative files; however, counter-evidence against an official finding that a certain fact was generally known would have been admitted. \nthe administrative court concluded that, as the appellant had failed to raise the objection that the issue was not a fact of general knowledge and to contend that he was in a position to bring counter-evidence, the finding of the defendant office had remained uncontested. 13.  in 1991 the municipality of cologne obtained the painting as a temporary loan from the brno historical monuments office in the czech republic. 14.  on 11 november 1991 the cologne regional court (landgericht) granted the applicant\u2019s request for an interim injunction ordering the municipality of cologne to hand over the painting to a bailiff at the end of the exhibition. the painting was sequestrated on 17 december 1991. 15.  at the beginning of 1992 the applicant instituted proceedings before the cologne regional court against the municipality of cologne, requesting that the defendant consent to the delivery of the painting to him by the bailiff. he argued that, as his late father\u2019s heir, he was the owner of the painting. he submitted that the painting had not been subject to expropriation measures in the former czechoslovakia and that in any event such measures were invalid or irrelevant on account of violation of the ordre public of the federal republic of germany. 16.  the brno historical monuments office intervened in these proceedings in support of the defendant. it submitted that the applicant\u2019s father had lost his ownership of the painting as a result of the confiscation in 1946 and that the lawfulness of this confiscation had been confirmed by the bratislava administrative court in its decision of 21 november 1951. 17.  on 10 october 1995 the cologne regional court, following a hearing, declared the applicant\u2019s action inadmissible. in the court\u2019s view, chapter 6, article 3, of the convention on the settlement of matters arising out of the war and the occupation (vertrag zur regelung aus krieg und besatzung entstandener fragen \u2013 \u201cthe settlement convention\u201d) of 23 october 1954 between the united states of america, the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, the french republic and the federal republic of germany excluded german jurisdiction over the applicant\u2019s case. \nin its reasoning, the regional court noted that, under the terms of that article\u2019s paragraph 3 taken in conjunction with paragraph 1, claims or actions against persons having acquired or transferred title to property on the basis of measures carried out with regard to german external assets or other property, seized for the purpose of reparation or restitution, or as a result of the state of war, or on the basis of specific agreements, were not admissible. these particular provisions had been confirmed upon german unification.\naccording to the regional court, chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3, of the settlement convention applied, mutatis mutandis, to the applicant\u2019s claims against the defendant, which had obtained the painting on loan and had not acquired property, because any review of the aforementioned measures should be excluded.\nthe regional court found that the confiscation of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s property under decree no. 12 on the \u201cconfiscation and accelerated allocation of agricultural property of german and hungarian persons and of those having committed treason and acted as enemies of the czech and slovak people\u201d, issued by the president of the former czechoslovakia on 21 june 1945, constituted a measure within the meaning of chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3. \nthe regional court rejected, in particular, the applicant\u2019s argument that this provision did not apply as it only concerned measures carried out with regard to german external assets or other property and his father had never been a german citizen. in this respect, the court, referring to case-law of the federal court of justice (bundesgerichtshof), stated that the view of the confiscating state was decisive. the aim and purpose of this provision, namely to sanction, without any further examination, confiscation measures implemented abroad could only be achieved by excluding such measures from judicial review in germany.\nmoreover, the regional court found that the confiscation measure in question pursued one of the purposes mentioned in chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3. having regard to german case-law regarding other \u201cbene\u0161 decrees\u201d, especially decree no. 108 on the \u201cconfiscation of enemy property and the national reform fund\u201d, it considered that decree no. 12, while also pursuing economic aims, was intended to expropriate the property of german and hungarian nationals, that is, \u201cenemy property\u201d.\nthe regional court further noted that the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s painting had been expropriated under decree no. 12. the competent czechoslovakian authorities had interpreted its provisions as applying to the applicant\u2019s father, regarding him as a \u201cperson of german nationality\u201d.  the applicant\u2019s father had unsuccessfully appealed against this decision which had been confirmed by the bratislava administrative court in 1951. the german courts were not in a position to review the lawfulness of the confiscation at issue.\nfinally, the regional court considered that the painting at issue, as part of the inventory of the agricultural property, had been included in the confiscation measure. \nthe regional court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request to suspend the proceedings in order to await the outcome of proceedings to be instituted under the german equalisation of burdens act (lastenausgleichsgesetz) concerning compensation for damage and losses due to, inter alia, expulsion and destruction during the second world war and the post-war period in the then soviet-occupied zone of germany and of berlin. the regional court considered that the question underlying the litigation before it would not be clarified in such proceedings. irrespective of the question of whether the plaintiff was of german origin, he had no equalisation claims under the said legislation, which only applied to persons who resided in the federal republic of germany or west berlin on 31 december 1952. in any event, there was no right to compensation for the loss of works of art (kunstgegenst\u00e4nde). 18.  on 9 july 1996 the cologne court of appeal (oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. the court of appeal confirmed that the applicant\u2019s action was inadmissible as german jurisdiction in respect of his claim was excluded under chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 1, in conjunction with paragraph 3, of the settlement convention.\nthe court of appeal considered that the notion of german jurisdiction included the competence, derived from state sovereignty and generally vested by the state in the courts, to administer justice. german jurisdiction was delimited by international agreements, customary international law and the generally recognised rules of international law. chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3, taken in conjunction with paragraph 1, of the settlements convention excluded german jurisdiction in respect of claims and actions against persons, who, as a consequence of reparation measures, had directly or indirectly acquired title to german property confiscated abroad.\nthe court of appeal confirmed that the provisions in question continued to be in force under the treaty of 12 september 1990 on the final settlement with respect to germany. article 7 of this treaty, which provided for the termination of the operation of quadripartite rights and responsibilities with respect to berlin and germany as a whole, was amended by the agreement of 27 and 28 september 1990 according to which the settlement convention was suspended and later terminated with the exception of the provisions specified in paragraph 3 of that agreement, inter alia, chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3. that agreement was valid under public international law and under german constitutional law.\nthe court of appeal further considered that chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3, of the settlement convention applied in the applicant\u2019s case. in the court\u2019s view, this provision was the procedural consequence of the notion that the legal relations resulting from the liquidation of german property abroad by foreign powers for the purpose of reparation were \u201cfinal and unchallengeable\u201d (endg\u00fcltigkeit und unanfechtbarkeit) for the federal republic of germany and the private persons concerned. \naccording to the court of appeal, the applicant\u2019s constitutional rights, in particular his right to property, his right of access to a court and his right to a decision by the legally competent court (gesetzlicher richter), had not been infringed. basic rights protected individuals against acts of domestic public authorities and not against the exercise of public authority by a foreign state abroad. the domestic legislator was therefore not prevented from limiting domestic legal protection against violations of basic rights by a foreign state if this was necessary to attain more important goals.\nwhen applying chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3, of the settlement convention, the domestic law of the expropriating state concerning the concrete confiscation measure had to be taken into account, as this provision was aimed at excluding litigation in germany regarding confiscation measures based on legislation concerning enemy property. \nas regards the applicant\u2019s objections against the lawfulness, in particular under public international law, of the confiscation and expropriation of his father\u2019s property, the court of appeal found that by virtue of chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3 of the settlement convention, german courts had no jurisdiction. likewise, this provision did not allow recourse to be had to general rules of public international law or to german ordre public when examining the admissibility of the action. the applicant\u2019s argument that the provisions of the settlement convention and their application to him as a national and head of a neutral state violated the law of peace was accordingly rejected.\naccording to the court of appeal, the painting at issue constituted external assets within the meaning of chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 1, of the settlement convention, referred to in paragraph 3 of article 3. the court of appeal noted that the applicant\u2019s father had indisputably never had german nationality. however, following the case-law of the federal court of justice, it considered that the notion of \u201cgerman external assets\u201d had to be interpreted in the light of the law of the expropriating state. the confiscation in dispute had been found to be in compliance with the legislation of the expropriating state: the competent czechoslovakian administrative authorities as well as the bratislava administrative court had found that presidential decree no. 12 of 21 june 1945 applied to the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s confiscated property. article 1 \u00a7 1 (a) of this decree provided for the confiscation of agricultural properties of \u201call persons of german or hungarian nationality\u201d irrespective of their citizenship. the notions of \u201cgerman nationality\u201d, or of \u201cgerman origin\u201d (\u201cdeutsche volkszugeh\u00f6rigkeit\u201d), likewise used at that time, comprised as relevant elements a person\u2019s citizenship and nationality, the latter depending on the mother tongue. at the relevant time, the czechoslovakian authorities indisputably regarded the applicant\u2019s father as of german origin in that broader sense.\nthe court of appeal also found that the painting at issue, as part of the confiscated agricultural property, had been subject to the expropriation measure. there were no doubts as to the effectiveness of the expropriation, as it was sufficient under the relevant case-law that such expropriations had been implemented and that the previous owners had been deprived of their factual power of disposition. furthermore, the painting had been confiscated for the purpose of reparation within the meaning of chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, of the settlement agreement. the limitation of the confiscation measures to persons belonging to enemy states in itself justified such a conclusion. the assets of the persons concerned were confiscated as enemy assets.  \nfinally, the court of appeal considered that both the defendant and the intervener belonged to the group of persons protected by chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 3, of the settlement agreement. german jurisdiction was excluded whenever the plaintiff intended to challenge measures within the meaning of chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 1. 19.  on 25 september 1997 the federal court of justice refused to entertain the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law, as the case was of no fundamental importance and, in any event, had no prospect of success. 20.  on 28 january 1998 the third section of the second division (3. kammer des zweiten senats) of the federal constitutional court (bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint (verfassungsbeschwerde), as it offered no prospect of success. \nthe federal constitutional court considered in particular that, for the purposes of the civil court decisions, questions as to the existence or non-existence of certain rules of customary international law on the confiscation of neutral assets or on the determination of citizenship were irrelevant as they concerned the issue of the lawfulness of the expropriation by the former czechoslovakia. the german civil courts had not decided this issue and, under public international law, they had not been obliged to do so. moreover, to the extent that the civil courts had regarded the expropriation as a measure within the meaning of chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7 1, of the settlement convention, they had expressly refrained from qualifying the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s nationality. their interpretation of the terms \u201cmeasures with regard to german external assets\u201d as comprising any measures which, in the intention of the expropriating state, were directed against german assets, could not be objected to under constitutional law. the bar on litigation did not constitute an agreement to the detriment of liechtenstein, as only the federal republic of germany and its courts were under this treaty obligation.\nthe federal constitutional court further recalled that the exclusion of jurisdiction did not amount to a violation of the right of property as these clauses and the settlement convention as a whole served to settle matters dating back to a time before the entry into force of the german basic law (grundgesetz) on 23 may 1949.\nfinally, there was no indication of arbitrariness or of a violation of other constitutional rights. the federal constitutional court confirmed that chapter 6, article 3 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, of the settlement convention had not been set aside by the treaty on the final settlement with respect to germany: while germany obtained full sovereignty, its obligations under treaties with the three powers were not affected. this had also been the legal opinion of the federal republic of germany and the three powers, which otherwise would not have settled the suspension and termination of parts of the settlement convention in a separate agreement.\nthe decision was served on 2 february 1998. 21.  on 9 june 1998 the cologne regional court discharged its interim injunction of 11 november 1991. the bailiff thereupon handed the painting over to the cologne municipality, which had it returned to the czech republic.", "labels": ["14", "P1-1", "6"]}
{"text": "9.  in june 1949 plots of agricultural land owned by the applicant\u2019s father were expropriated by the former doksy district national council (okresn\u00ed n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor) under the czechoslovak new land reform act no. 46/1948 (\u201cthe 1948 act\u201d). the applicant\u2019s father had never obtained any compensation. in 1957 some of these plots were transferred to the ownership of natural persons in an assignment procedure under the 1948 act. in 1977 the applicant\u2019s father died and the applicant\u2019s rights over his estate were confirmed. 10.  after the fall of the communist regime in czechoslovakia, the act no. 229/1991 on adjustment of ownership rights in respect of land and other agricultural property (\u201cz\u00e1kon o p\u016fd\u011b\u201d, the \u201cland ownership act\u201d) entered into force on 24 june 1991. the act provided that the 1948 act was no longer applicable and that under certain conditions property confiscated pursuant to that act without compensation could be returned to its former owners or their heirs if it was still in the possession of the state or of a legal person. however, if such property had been transferred into the possession of natural persons, the former owners or their heirs could \u2013 subject to certain exceptions \u2013 only claim the assignment of other equivalent property or financial compensation. 11.  on the basis of the land ownership act, the applicant entered into restitution agreements with two legal persons (the hradec kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 state forest enterprise and the l\u00edny \u2013

\u201cthe land office\u201d) refused to approve the restitution agreements. referring to section 32(3) of the land ownership act, it found that some of the plots had been assigned to different owners pursuant to the 1948 act, and that these owners, being natural persons, had proved their property rights by showing their deeds of assignment. the land office based its decisions on the following documents: the decision of the former mlad\u00e1 boleslav state notary (st\u00e1tn\u00ed not\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed) of 26 may 1977 on the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s inheritance, the decision of the

(krajsk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor) of 29 november 1949 by which the decision of expropriation had been modified, and an extract (v\u00fdpis) from the land register (pozemkov\u00e1 kniha) relating to the l\u00edny and kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 ves districts. the land office had also at its disposal copies of the deeds of assignment made out by the mlad\u00e1 boleslav land register office (katastr\u00e1ln\u00ed \u00fa\u0159ad) on 23 september 1994. 12.  it appears from the text of the invitation issued by the land office on 28 september 1994 that the latter scheduled a hearing for 12 october 1994 to which the applicant and his lawyer were invited, together with the representatives of the state forest enterprise, the agricultural cooperative and representatives of the mlad\u00e1 boleslav land fund (pozemkov\u00fd fond). according to the record of the hearing, only the applicant and the representatives of the state forest enterprise and of the agricultural cooperative attended the hearing. the applicant refused to make any comments on the issue of the administrative proceedings and did not sign the record. the representatives of both legal persons left the hearing before the end. 13.  on 11 november 1994 the applicant lodged appeals with the prague municipal court (m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud, \u201cthe municipal court\u201d) against the two administrative decisions. he claimed the restitution of the entire property, contesting that the acquisition of part thereof had been proven by the natural persons concerned and requesting access to the respective deeds of assignment. 14.  on 31 may 1995 the municipal court joined both appeals and upheld the administrative decisions of 12 october 1994. it held that the land office had correctly refused to approve the restitution agreements as a whole as they also covered property whose ownership had been transferred to natural persons and thus could not be returned to the original owner. this had been established on the basis of all relevant documents including the deeds of assignment, which were included in the administrative files. the applicant could have consulted them at any time during the administrative proceedings if he had wished to do so as provided for in section 23(1) of the code of administrative procedure. the municipal court considered that no hearing was necessary in the applicant\u2019s case, as the facts had been correctly established by the administrative authority and only points of law were in issue before it. in this respect, it referred to section 250(f) of the code of civil procedure. 15.  the case was referred back to the land office pursuant to section 9(3) of the land ownership act (see paragraph 25 below) which gave a new decision on 25 july 1995. in accordance with the opinion of the municipal court, by which it was bound by virtue of section 250(r) of the code of civil procedure, the land office confirmed the applicant\u2019s property rights in respect of those plots which had not been transferred to natural persons under the 1948 act. at the same time, it informed the applicant that he could seek compensation under section 11 or 16 of the land ownership act for the plots which could not be returned to him. 16.  on 14 september and 15 october 1995 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal (\u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost) claiming inter alia that his property rights had been violated, that he had not been able to put forward further evidence and that the municipal court had not informed him about its decision to join both cases. he invoked inter alia articles 36 and 38 of the charter of fundamental rights and freedoms (listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod). 17.  on 29 november 1995 the constitutional court (\u00fastavn\u00ed soud) rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal as manifestly ill-founded. it considered that the applicant\u2019s constitutional rights to a proper court procedure had not been violated by the manner in which the municipal court had dealt with his appeal. having regard to the special nature of the judicial review of administrative decisions, the court\u2019s function was limited to a legal reassessment of the case on the basis of the facts established by the administrative authority. the applicant had not invoked evidence disregarded by the land office and, by merely articulating his discontent with the latter\u2019s decision, had not raised any valid objection to the facts as established by it. furthermore, according to the constitutional court, the municipal court had not infringed constitutional law by deciding the case without a hearing as this was lawful under section 250(f) of the code of civil procedure when the case involved only the assessment of points of law. 18.  on 1 may 1998 the applicant died. nevertheless, his lawyer introduced before the land office a request for compensation by the assignment of other plots pursuant to section 11(2) of the land ownership act. according to the government, this request is still pending before the land office. 19.  on 29 october 1998 the judicial proceedings regarding the applicant\u2019s inheritance were terminated by a finding of the prague 2 district court that the applicant had not left any estate. apparently, the court was not aware of the land office\u2019s decision of 25 july 1995. 20.  on 22 february 2000 the applicant\u2019s nephew, mr bou\u010dek, requested the district court to re-open the inheritance proceedings. he produced his uncle\u2019s last will of 22 march 1998 in which he was designated as a universal heir of the applicant\u2019s estate, while the applicant\u2019s two adult children were disinherited. the re-opening of the judicial proceedings concerning the inheritance was eventually granted on 21 august 2000. on 28 march 2001 the prague 2 district court approved an agreement concluded between mr bou\u010dek and the applicant\u2019s two children concerning the division of the applicant\u2019s estate on an equal basis.", "labels": ["6"]}
{"text": "8.  in 1991 mr du\u0161an slobodn\u00edk, a research worker in the field of literature, published an autobiography entitled paragraph: polar circle. he described in it, inter alia, his conviction by a soviet military tribunal in 1945 on the ground that he had been ordered to spy on the soviet army after having been enrolled, in 1944 when he was 17 years old, in a military training course organised by germans. in the book, mr slobodn\u00edk also wrote about his detention in soviet gulags and his rehabilitation by the supreme court of the union of the soviet socialist republics in 1960. in june 1992 mr slobodn\u00edk became minister for culture and education of the slovak republic. 9.  on 20 july 1992 the newspaper telegraf published a poem by the applicant. it was dated 17 july 1992 (the day when the sovereignty of the slovak republic was solemnly proclaimed) and entitled \u201cgood night, my beloved\u201d (\u201cdobr\u00fa noc, m\u00e1 mil\u00e1\u201d). one of its verses read as follows:\n\u201cin prague prisoner havel is giving up his presidential office. in bratislava the prosecutor rules again. and rule by one party is above the law. a member of the ss and a member of the \u0161tb [the \u0161tb (\u0161t\u00e1tna bezpe\u010dnos\u0165) was the secret police during the communist regime in czechoslovakia] embraced each other.\u201d 10.  the poem was later published in another newspaper. in separate articles, two journalists alleged that the expression \u201cmember of the ss\u201d stood for mr du\u0161an slobodn\u00edk. 11.  on 30 july 1992 several newspapers published a statement which the applicant had distributed to the public information service (verejn\u00e1 informa\u010dn\u00e1 slu\u017eba) the day before. it was entitled \u201cfor a better picture of slovakia \u2013 without a minister with a fascist past\u201d (\u201cza lep\u0161\u00ed obraz slovenska \u2013 bez ministra s fa\u0161istickou minulos\u0165ou\u201d). it read as follows:\n\u201cthere has been a problem about how to keep a democratic character in [the slovakian] national emancipation process, which we have tried to resolve many times. until now, slovakia has lost most when matters related to the slovakian nation were in the hands of the wrong people who led us away from democratic evolution. the cost was high: for example, the combatants\u2019 lives lost in the slovakian national uprising [in 1944 and 1945] . \nnow, we are scared that this mistake could be made again. to say that our way to europe is by working together and cooperating in its democratic evolution is not enough. this is a direct condition arising from international law without the fulfilment of which no one in europe will take notice of us.\ni expressed this concern in my polemics with mr du\u0161an slobodn\u00edk last year; life has finished the writing of our polemics, and my views were proved correct.\nthis year mr slobodn\u00edk became the slovak republic\u2019s minister for culture and education and the next thing was that his fascist past came out in public. mr slobodn\u00edk managed this situation in a way that allowed the writer ladislav m\u0148a\u010dko to prove he was a liar. but he still has not given up his ministerial post, although in any other democratic country he would have had to do so a long time ago.\ndoes mr slobodn\u00edk think that slovakia is some special exception and that it is the only country having the right to revise the philosophy of the nuremberg trials, which is binding on the post-war development of all other european countries? or is the message of the slovakian national uprising not correct? ... does mr me\u010diar think that having this minister in the government will help him to persuade people in europe that his talk about the democratic intentions of his government is serious? is it good to have mr slobodn\u00edk in the government when this fact will lead to the political, economic and cultural isolation of slovakia? \nmr slobodn\u00edk likes to use every chance to talk about improving the image of slovakia around the world. i fully agree with him on this. he has a personal opportunity to do something in order to improve the image of slovakia: to resign.\u201d 12.  on 5 august 1992 mr slobodn\u00edk publicly declared that he would sue the applicant for the above statement. 13.  in an interview published in the czech daily lidov\u00e9 noviny on 12 august 1992 the applicant stated, inter alia:\n\u201c... when i speak of the fascist past [of mr slobodn\u00edk], i do not characterise him, i only think that the fact that he attended a terrorist training course organised by the ss falls within the term \u2018fascist past\u2019. i consider that such a person has nothing to do in the government of a democratic state ...\u201d 14.  in the context of the nomination of mr slobodn\u00edk to a post in the government, issues relating to his past were taken up by several slovakian and czech newspapers both before and after the publication of the applicant\u2019s statement. articles concerning this subject were also published in the new york times, on 22 july 1992, the tribune de gen\u00e8ve, on 18 september 1992, izvestia on 31 august 1992, as well as by the austrian press agency. the new york times, the tribune de gen\u00e8ve and izvestia later published the reaction of mr slobodn\u00edk to their respective articles. 15.  on 9 september 1992 mr slobodn\u00edk sued the applicant for defamation under article 11 et seq. of the civil code before the bratislava city court (mestsk\u00fd s\u00fad). he later extended the action and alleged that the verses \u201cin bratislava the prosecutor rules again. and rule by one party is above the law. a member of the ss and a member of the \u0161tb embraced each other\u201d from the applicant\u2019s poem referred to him. he also alleged that the above-mentioned statement published in the newspapers wrongly referred to his fascist past. the plaintiff claimed that the applicant should bear the costs of publication of an apology in five newspapers and also pay him 250,000 slovakian korunas (skk) as compensation. 16.  on 18 october 1993 the bratislava city court dismissed the action. it established that the plaintiff had been a member of the hlinka youth (hlinkova ml\u00e1de\u017e) and that in february and march 1945 he had participated in a terrorist training course in sekule. it observed that the hlinka youth had been a military corps of the hlinka slovakian people\u2019s party (hlinkova slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana) and that under the law then in force the slovak nation had participated in the exercise of state power through the intermediary of that party. the court pointed out that, under article 5 of presidential decree no. 5/1945 of 19 may 1945, legal persons which had deliberately promoted the war waged by germany and hungary or had served fascist and nazi aims were to be considered unworthy of the state\u2019s trust. 17.  the city court further established that in may 1945 a military tribunal of the soviet army had sentenced mr slobodn\u00edk to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the ground that he had attended the training course in sekule and had been ordered, on 22 march 1945, to cross the front line and to spy on soviet troops. the military tribunal\u2019s judgment further stated that mr slobodn\u00edk had not crossed the front line but had gone home in april 1945, when he had been arrested. the city court also noted that the plaintiff had served the sentence in soviet camps until his release in 1953. in 1960 the supreme court of the ussr had quashed the sentence and discontinued the proceedings for the lack of factual elements of an offence. 18.  before the city court, mr slobodn\u00edk claimed that he had been a member of the hlinka youth only for a short time and that he had joined the organisation only because it had been a prerequisite for his participation in a table-tennis tournament. he further explained that he had been summoned to the training course in sekule and that he had complied with the summons out of fear for himself and his family. mr slobodn\u00edk alleged that he had been excluded from the course as being unreliable after he had expressed his negative opinion about it. he had then been taken to the hlinka youth headquarters in bratislava, from where he had been allowed to return home to bansk\u00e1 bystrica under the condition that he would report on the soviet army. however, the city court did not find these facts established. in particular, it did not consider as relevant evidence the description of the events contained in the plaintiff\u2019s book paragraph: polar circle, which had been published earlier. in its view, the fact that the 1945 sentence had been quashed did not prove that the plaintiff had not been a member of the hlinka youth and that he had not attended the training course in sekule. 19.  the city court also noted that the relevant period of mr slobodn\u00edk\u2019s life had been covered by the press both in slovakia and abroad prior to the applicant\u2019s statement, and that on several occasions mr slobodn\u00edk himself had commented and given interviews on those issues, both in slovakia and abroad. the court concluded that, in the statement, the applicant had expressed his opinion on the basis of information which had already been published in the press. the statement concerned a public figure who was inevitably exposed to close scrutiny and sometimes also to criticism by other members of society. by making the statement, the applicant had exercised his right to freedom of expression and he had not unjustifiably interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s personality rights. 20.  mr slobodn\u00edk appealed to the supreme court (najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad), alleging that the applicant had not proved that he had a \u201cfascist past\u201d, and that the city court had not established the meaning of that term. mr slobodn\u00edk argued that he had been summoned to the training course in sekule by an order and that he had left it at the first opportunity after he had learned about its real purpose. he also explained that martial law had been in force at the material time and that people had been unlawfully executed or detained. members of the hlinka youth had been incorporated in the armed forces by a presidential order and had fallen under military judicial and disciplinary rules. the plaintiff maintained that he had done nothing against his homeland or the anti-fascist allies and concluded that the applicant\u2019s statement and poem were defamatory. 21.  the applicant contended, in particular, that the courts should abandon their established practice according to which the defendant has to prove the truthfulness of his statements in defamation proceedings. he maintained that the burden of proof should be shifted onto the plaintiff or shared between the parties. the applicant further argued that his statement was a value judgment based on the undisputed facts that the plaintiff had been a member of the hlinka youth and that he had attended a terrorist training course in sekule. it was irrelevant to what extent the plaintiff had been involved in the activities of the hlinka youth or for how long he had been a member of it. what mattered was that the plaintiff had voluntarily joined the organisation and that, after his alleged exclusion from the training course in sekule, he had undertaken, as shown by the soviet military tribunal\u2019s judgment of 19 may 1945, to provide information on the movements of soviet troops to the headquarters of the hlinka youth. the applicant therefore proposed that the appeal be dismissed. 22.  on 23 march 1994 the supreme court reversed the first-instance judgment, ruling as follows:\n\u201c... [the applicant] has to accept that ... du\u0161an slobodn\u00edk will distribute, if he thinks fit, to the press agency of the slovak republic as well as to five newspapers of his choice, both in slovakia and abroad, the following declaration to be published at [the applicant\u2019s] expense:\n  \u2018(1)  [the applicant\u2019s] statement addressed to [the public information service] and published in daily newspapers on 30 july 1992 which reads: \u201c...this year mr slobodn\u00edk became the slovak republic\u2019s minister for culture and education and the next thing was that his fascist past came out in public ... does mr slobodn\u00edk think that slovakia is some special exception and that it is the only country having the right to revise the philosophy of the nuremberg trials, which is binding on the post-war development of all other european countries? ...\u201d\n  (2)  the occasional poem ... entitled \u201cgood night, my beloved\u201d in its part \u201c... in bratislava the prosecutor rules again. and rule by one party is above the law. a member of the ss and a member of the \u0161tb embraced each other ...\u201d \n  ... represent a gross slander and disparagement of the civil honour and life, and an unjustified interference with the personality of the plaintiff du\u0161an slobodn\u00edk.\u2019\n...\n  (4)  [the applicant] is liable to pay skk 200,000 to the plaintiff in respect of non-pecuniary damage. ...\u2019 \u201d 23.  the applicant was also ordered to pay costs and the other party\u2019s expenses. 24.  the supreme court noted that the plaintiff had described the relevant events in his book paragraph: polar circle before the dispute concerning his past had arisen, and that no other relevant facts had been established in the course of the proceedings. 25.  in the appellate court\u2019s view, the term \u201cfascist past\u201d was equivalent to the statement that a person was a fascist in the past. the court considered that the applicant himself had given a restrictive interpretation of that term in connection with the plaintiff, namely the interpretation according to the philosophy of the nuremberg trials. this philosophy was derived from the multilateral agreement of 8 august 1945, which included also the statute of the international military tribunal, and which had become part of the czechoslovakian legal order on 2 october 1947. the supreme court held that it was bound by the principle of individual responsibility set out in that agreement. 26.  the supreme court further studied all available documents and evidence used during the nuremberg trials relating to slovakia. it found no reference in those documents to the hlinka youth in connection with fascist organisations. it established that the propagation or implementation of fascist theories had not been inherent in the statutory rules and regulations governing the hlinka youth. if some persons had abused the christian principles on which the organisation had been built, this had contravened the rules then in force. such persons and, as the case might be, those who had let themselves be abused for criminal purposes, were individually responsible. however, such was not the case of the plaintiff. the supreme court accepted the latter\u2019s argument that he had learned about the character of the training course in sekule only after he had started attending it. 27.  the appellate court found irrelevant the reference, in the first-instance court\u2019s judgment, to presidential decree no. 5/1945 of 19 may 1945 as that decree had only concerned property, in that it had placed under national administration the property of persons whom the state had considered unreliable. 28.  the supreme court recalled that, at the relevant time, criminal and moral liability had been governed by order no. 33 on the punishment of fascist criminals, occupants, traitors and collaborators and on the establishment of the people\u2019s judiciary adopted by the slovakian national council on 15 may 1945 and also by presidential decree no. 16/1945 of 19 june 1945 on the punishment of nazi criminals, traitors and their assistants and on extra-ordinary people\u2019s courts. these rules were partly based on the principle of collective liability, but they did not mention the hlinka youth. 29.  as regards the poem by the applicant, the supreme court noted that it was dated 17 july 1992, that is, the day on which the sovereignty of the slovak republic had been proclaimed from the balcony of the slovakian national council, where mr slobodn\u00edk had also been present. shortly afterwards, the applicant had written his statement concerning mr slobodn\u00edk\u2019s past and two journalists had interpreted the poem as a description of the scene during the proclamation. they had alleged that by \u201cmember of the ss\u201d the applicant had meant to designate mr slobodn\u00edk. the court therefore concluded that the applicant had infringed the plaintiff\u2019s personality rights by his poem as well as by his statement of 29 july 1992. 30.  the applicant\u2019s request that the burden of proof in the case should be shifted onto the plaintiff or at least shared between the parties was not accepted as it had no basis in domestic law and practice. the supreme court concluded that the applicant had not proved that mr slobodn\u00edk had been a fascist in the past, holding that the latter had joined the hlinka youth because he had wanted to participate in sports activities and had not been motivated by fascist sympathies. as to the training course in sekule, it found that mr slobodn\u00edk had not completed it, and it was irrelevant whether he had been excluded or had left it on his own initiative. the only relevant fact was that the plaintiff\u2019s past could not be considered fascist from that point of view. 31.  the applicant filed an appeal on points of law alleging, inter alia, a violation of his rights under article 10 of the convention. he claimed that the supreme court should have concluded from the relevant provisions of presidential decree no. 5/1945 that the hlinka youth was a fascist organisation and that, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the slovakian national council\u2019s orders nos. 1/1944 and 4/1944, participation in any activity within the hlinka youth was to be considered as participation in an unlawful fascist organisation. he further complained that the supreme court had not established with sufficient certainty whether the plaintiff had actually been excluded from the training course in sekule, and whether he had undertaken to carry out terrorist activities or not. 32.  on 25 may 1995 a different chamber of the supreme court sitting as a court of cassation upheld the part of the appeal judgment of 23 march 1994 according to which the plaintiff was entitled to arrange for publication of the text set out in it and concerning the applicant\u2019s statement of 29 july 1992. as for the remainder, the court of cassation quashed both the first and second-instance judgments and sent the case back to the bratislava city court. 33.  the court of cassation did not share the applicant\u2019s view that the plaintiff should be required to prove that the applicant\u2019s allegations were untrue. it further held that a person could be considered as having a fascist past only if he or she had propagated or practised fascism in an active manner. mere membership of an organisation and participation in a terrorist training course which had not been followed by any practical actions could not be characterised as a fascist past. 34.  as the applicant had failed to prove that the plaintiff had a fascist past within the above meaning, the court found that his statement had infringed without justification the plaintiff\u2019s personality rights. in the judgment, the court admitted that slovakian law characterised the hlinka youth as a fascist organisation. it recalled, however, that the relevant legal rules, including those relied on by the applicant, applied to natural persons only where justified by their specific actions. applying those rules to all members of such organisations without considering their actual deeds would entail the recognition of their collective guilt. it recalled that children over the age of 6 had been admitted to the hlinka youth. 35.  the court considered that the applicant\u2019s argument according to which his statement was a value judgment could only have been accepted if the applicant had expressly referred, in that statement, to the particular facts on which such a value judgment was based. the court stated, inter alia:\n\u201cindicating that the plaintiff has had a fascist past is not a value judgment based on an analysis of facts, but an allegation (statement) made without any concurrent justification of factual circumstances from which a conclusion can be inferred by the person making the judgment. it could have been a value judgment if the statement [of the applicant] had been accompanied by reference to the [plaintiff\u2019s] membership of the hlinka youth and his participation in the training course, namely, to the activities which the person making the judgment considers to constitute a fascist past. only such a statement, based on circumstantial facts used by the person making the judgment, would be a value judgment the truthfulness of which would not require any proof. only such an interpretation will guarantee a balance between the freedom of expression and the right to the protection of [a person\u2019s] reputation within the meaning of article 10 of the convention.\u201d 36.  the court then found the restriction on the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression compatible with the requirements of article 10 \u00a7 2 of the convention as it was necessary for the protection of the plaintiff\u2019s reputation in accordance with articles 11 et seq. of the civil code. 37.  as to the poem, the court of cassation quashed both the first and second-instance judgments for lack of evidence and held that in further proceedings the plaintiff would have to prove that the applicant had referred to him in the poem. it also quashed the part of the appeal concerning compensation for non-pecuniary damage and costs since their award depended on an assessment of both the interferences complained of by the plaintiff. 38.  on 15 april 1996 the bratislava city court reached a new decision on the remainder of the case. it stayed the proceedings as far as the poem was concerned on the ground that the plaintiff had withdrawn that part of the action. 39.  the city court further dismissed the claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage as it did not find it established that the applicant\u2019s statement had considerably diminished the plaintiff\u2019s dignity and position in society within the meaning of article 13 \u00a7 2 of the civil code. in its view, the plaintiff had failed to show that the considerable publicity concerning his person had arisen as a result of the applicant\u2019s statement and not, as the case might be, as a consequence of newspaper articles and the plaintiff\u2019s book published prior to the applicant\u2019s statement. 40.  having considered to what extent the parties had been successful in the proceedings, the city court ordered the plaintiff to pay skk 56,780 to the applicant in reimbursement of the relevant part of the latter\u2019s costs. the applicant and the plaintiff were further ordered to pay respectively skk 875 and 2,625 in reimbursement of the costs paid in advance by the court. 41.  on 25 november 1998 the supreme court upheld the decision of the bratislava city court to discontinue the proceedings in respect of the poem and to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damage. the supreme court held that

{"text": "12.  in 1987 the applicant association published a book entitled euskadi at war. there were four versions \u2013 basque, english, spanish and french \u2013 and the book was distributed in numerous countries, including france and spain. according to the applicant association, this was a collective work containing contributions from a number of academics with specialist knowledge of the basque country and giving an account of the historical, cultural, linguistic and socio-political aspects of the basque cause. it ended with a political article entitled \u201ceuskadi at war, a promise of peace\u201d by the basque national liberation movement. 13.  the book was published in the second quarter of 1987. on 29 april 1988 a ministerial order was issued by the french ministry of the interior under section 14 of the law of 29 july 1881, as amended by the decree of 6 may 1939, banning the circulation, distribution and sale of the book in france in any of its four versions on the ground that \u201cthe circulation in france of this book, which promotes separatism and vindicates recourse to violence, is likely to constitute a threat to public order\u201d. on 6 may 1988, pursuant to the aforementioned order, the d\u00e9partement director of the airport and border police refused to allow over two thousand copies of the book to be brought into france. 14.  on 1 june 1988 the applicant association lodged an administrative appeal against the ban. when this was implicitly rejected, it appealed to the pau administrative court on 29 november 1988. 15.  the administrative court held that it did not have jurisdiction and so referred the case to the conseil d\u2019etat. by a decision of 9 january 1991 the president of the judicial division of the conseil d\u2019etat remitted the case to the pau administrative court. 16.  in a judgment delivered on 1 june 1993 after a public hearing in the presence of both parties, the pau administrative court rejected the applicant association\u2019s appeal on the following grounds:\n\u201cit has been established that the book at issue entitled euskadi at war was printed in spain, that four of its five chapters were written by authors of spanish nationality and that the documentation used for the preparation of the publication was mainly of spanish origin. therefore, and notwithstanding the fact that the book was published by the applicant association, which is based in bayonne, the offending book must be regarded as of foreign origin within the meaning of the aforementioned provisions. accordingly, the minister of the interior was legally entitled to prohibit the book\u2019s circulation, distribution and sale.\nin taking the view that the book at issue could pose a threat to public order since it argued, particularly in chapter 4, that the violence of the spanish state justified the eta terrorist organisation\u2019s \u2018proportionate counter-offensive\u2019, the minister of the interior did not make any obvious error in assessing the evidence.\nunder article 10 of the european convention on human rights, \u2018[e]veryone has the right to freedom ...\u2019; it is the task of the administrative courts to assess whether any restriction of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the above-mentioned article 10 is proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued and to assess whether the ban on a publication of foreign origin is in keeping with that aim. in the instant case the evidence does not show that the general prohibition of the book at issue was disproportionate to the public-order objectives being pursued ...\u201d 17.  the applicant association lodged an appeal against this judgment with the conseil d\u2019etat on 20 august 1993. in its further observations, it asked the conseil d\u2019etat to find that section 14 of the law of 29 july 1881, as amended, was incompatible with articles 10 and 14 of the convention taken together. 18.  on 9 july 1997 the conseil d\u2019etat ruled that section 14 of the law of 1881, as amended, was not incompatible with articles 10 and 14 of the convention on the following grounds:\n\u201cunder section 14 of the law of 29 july 1881, as amended by the decree of 6 may 1939, \u2018the circulation, distribution or sale in france of newspapers or texts written in a foreign language, whether periodicals or not, may be prohibited by a decision of the minister of the interior. newspapers and texts of foreign origin written in french and printed abroad or in france may also be prohibited\u2019. in the absence of any statutory provision establishing the conditions circumscribing the legality of decisions taken on the basis of this provision, any restrictions of the minister\u2019s power derive from the need to reconcile the general interests for which he is responsible with the respect due to public freedoms, particularly freedom of the press. when an appeal against such a prohibition order is lodged with an administrative court, it is duty-bound to assess whether the banned publication poses such a threat to these general interests that it warrants an infringement of public freedoms. contrary to the applicant association\u2019s assertions, the power thus exercised by the minister of the interior, under the supervision of the courts, is not incompatible with the combined provisions of articles 10 and 14 of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms \u2026\u201d 19.  on the other hand, the conseil d\u2019etat quashed the judgment and the ministerial order of 29 april 1988 on the following grounds:\n\u201cby the impugned order, the minister of the interior prohibited the circulation, distribution and sale of the collective work euskadi at war, which must be viewed as a written text of foreign origin within the meaning of the aforementioned section 14 of the law of 29 july 1881. having regard to the interests that the minister is responsible for protecting, in particular public safety and public order, the court finds that the content of this publication does not provide sufficient legal justification for the serious infringement of press freedom embodied in the impugned decision.\nit follows from the above considerations that the association ekin has good grounds for maintaining that the pau administrative court was wrong to reject, by means of the impugned judgment, the association\u2019s application to set aside the decision of 29 april 1988, taken on the basis of the aforementioned section 14 of the law of 29 july 1881, by which the minister of the interior prohibited the circulation, distribution, and sale in france of the book entitled euskadi at war, published by the association ...\u201d 20.  in a registered letter with recorded delivery received by the ministry of the interior on 2 december 1997, the applicant association presented the minister with a claim for compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the application of the unlawful order of 29 april 1988 for more than nine years. according to the applicant association, the implementation of this order amounted to tortious conduct on the part of the authority. it estimated the overall losses it had sustained at 831,000 french francs (frf), including frf 481,000 resulting from the financial loss deriving directly from the prohibition of sales of the book throughout france. to date it has not had any reply from the minister of the interior. under the rules of french administrative proceedings, this silence counts as a refusal of the applicant association\u2019s claim.", "labels": ["14", "10", "6"]}
{"text": "7.  the applicants are former members of the turkish national assembly and of the democracy party (dep), which was dissolved by the constitutional court on 16 june 1994. 8.  the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court accused them of having infringed article 125 of the turkish criminal code and made repeated applications \u2013 on 27 november 1991, 16 december 1992, 25 may 1993 and 2 july 1993 \u2013 for their parliamentary immunity to be lifted.\non 2 march 1994 the national assembly, having deliberated on the basis of the application of 16 december 1992, decided to lift the applicants\u2019 parliamentary immunity under article 83 of the turkish constitution. 9.  on 2 march 1994 mr dicle and mr do\u011fan were taken into police custody on the orders of the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court. on 4 march 1994 mrs zana suffered the same fate.\na few days later the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court ordered the detention of those three applicants in police custody to be extended until 16 march 1994. 10.  while in custody, the applicants made no statements to the police. 11.  on 16 march 1994 they were brought before a judge of the ankara national security court and placed in detention pending trial. 12.  on 16 june 1994 the constitutional court dissolved the dep and ordered the party\u2019s mps to vacate their parliamentary seats. 13.  mr sadak was taken into police custody on 1 july 1994 and placed in detention pending trial on 12 july 1994. 14.  in the meantime, on 21 june 1994 the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court had filed a bill of indictment in which he accused the applicants of treason against the integrity of the state \u2013 a capital offence under article 125 of the criminal code. the accusation was based firstly on the activities that the applicants were alleged to have engaged in on behalf of the workers\u2019 party of kurdistan (pkk) (harbouring militants and providing one of them with medical care, negotiating with local leaders or proffering threats against them to make them help the pkk establish itself in their regions) and secondly on the content of oral and written statements by the applicants expressing support for pkk activities. on the evening of 21 june 1994 the offences of which the applicants were accused were announced in the news bulletin of the publicly owned trt 1 television channel. 15.  on 8 december 1994, the date of the final hearing before the ankara national security court, the applicants learned that the prosecution was proposing to alter the charge to belonging to an armed gang within the meaning of article 168 of the criminal code. the national security court invited the applicants to submit their observations on this new characterisation of the offences. the applicants\u2019 lawyers were not present at the hearing because they had decided to protest against the national security court\u2019s refusal to adopt a procedural measure they had requested of it. 16.  in a judgment of 8 december 1994 the ankara national security court sentenced the four applicants to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for belonging to an armed gang within the meaning of article 168, paragraph 2, of the turkish criminal code. it rejected the charge under article 125 of the criminal code, which provided for the death penalty in the event of treason against the integrity of the state. 17.  it found it established that the applicants had engaged in intensive \u201cseparatist\u201d activity under instructions from leaders of the pkk, a separatist armed gang seeking to found a kurdish state in south-eastern and eastern turkey. in that context it noted the following points: in the run-up to the 1991 parliamentary election the applicants had given speeches under the pkk banner at meetings where slogans had been shouted such as \u201clong live the pkk\u201d and \u201cstrike guerrillas strike, found kurdistan\u201d; the applicants had provoked unrest among the population and created an atmosphere that had undermined the authority of the state; they had worn pkk colours when they were sworn in as members of the national assembly in november 1991; at the congresses of their political parties, the hadep and the dep, the pkk flag had been hoisted instead of the turkish flag and the turkish republic had been described as an occupier and enemy; conversations recorded between three of the four applicants and heads of clans (a\u015firet reisi) in south-eastern and eastern anatolia had revealed that the former had used threats to try to persuade the latter to join or support the pkk; one of the applicants had harboured a pkk militant in his official residence, had helped him to obtain medical treatment and had fraudulently induced the state to pay his hospital bills; another had harboured in his home pkk militants preparing to join those who were already involved in field operations in the region; and all the applicants had made statements on behalf of the pkk in foreign countries and spread lies about the turkish state intended to uphold the pkk\u2019s views. the national security court also rejected an application by a co-defendant for a public hearing of a witness for the prosecution owing to the danger that the witness might suffer reprisals at the hands of the pkk. 18.  when classifying the facts found in the instant case as offences under article 168 rather than article 125 of the criminal code, the national security court referred to the case-law according to which article 125 defined a crime in terms of the ends pursued and article 168 in terms of the means deployed. treason against the integrity of the state within the meaning of article 125 was a crime which could only be made out if it was established that acts had been committed which were likely to pose a real threat to the state\u2019s survival. acts of violence and terrorism could fall within the scope of article 125 if they were serious enough to pose such a threat. article 168, paragraph 2, on the other hand, made it an offence merely to belong to an armed organisation which was already considered to be acting for a purpose contrary to article 125. the material element of the offence lay in the fact that the persons in question belonged to an armed organisation of the aforementioned type complete with a system of disciplinary rules and a hierarchical structure. in that context, it was not necessary for the defendants themselves to have committed acts posing a threat to the state\u2019s survival. however, article 168 did require a specific mental element, namely that the offenders were aware that they belonged to the illegal organisation. 19.  the applicants and the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court appealed on points of law against the judgment of 8 december 1994. 20.  the public prosecutor argued that the offences were indeed punishable under article 125 of the turkish criminal code. 21.  the applicants submitted for their part that the criminal proceedings had been brought for a political purpose, namely to suppress the opinions of members of parliament defending the kurdish cause. they contended that the national security court by which they had been convicted was a special political court which could not be considered an independent and impartial tribunal.\nthey also asserted that they had been denied a fair trial because, among other things, their equality of arms with the prosecution had not been respected. they complained in particular that they had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during their fifteen days in police custody; that their representatives had not had access to the documents on the case file during the preliminary investigation; that pressure had been brought to bear on their representatives by the government as their defence had been the subject of reports by the turkish secret services and their access to the courtroom had sometimes been impeded; that the applications filed by their representatives had never been allowed by the national security court; that they had not been permitted to examine before that court the witnesses interviewed by the prosecution during the preliminary investigation or the experts appointed by the prosecution; that their applications for the examination of the sound and video recordings made by the prosecution had been rejected by the national security court for no valid reason; that the evidence on which their conviction had been based had not been read out at the hearing; and that their applications for further witnesses to be heard and second opinions to be sought had been dismissed by the national security court. the applicants also argued that the difficulties encountered by certain lawyers and foreign delegations when attempting to enter the courtroom had infringed the requirement of a public hearing. lastly, they criticised the national security court for laying the activities of all pro-kurdish organisations, whether legal or illegal, at their door and taking account of findings of a political nature having no probative value with regard to the accusations levelled against them. 22.  in a judgment of 26 october 1995 the court of cassation upheld the decision at first instance as to the applicants\u2019 guilt and the sentences imposed on them. 23.  on the other hand it held that some of the reasons given by the ankara national security court in its judgment of 8 december 1994 could not be permitted to stand. when the telephone conversations between the applicants and the head of the pkk had been recorded the statutory provisions intended to safeguard the freedom of communication had been infringed; the fact that the applicants\u2019 diaries contained the names and addresses of pkk leaders did not prove the accusations; and the fact that some of the defendants (including two of the four applicants) had taken part in a press conference held by the head of the pkk could not in itself be regarded as an offence. 24.  in assessing each of the applicants\u2019 guilt, the court of cassation took account of various public communiqu\u00e9s that they had issued. in those documents they had described the parliamentary oath as racist on the ground that it omitted any reference to the kurdish identity, and asserted that the turkish government was waging war on the kurdish population, that kurdish uprisings had been suppressed using methods of genocide and that the national rights of the kurdish people were denied by the turkish state. 25.  regarding leyla zana, the court of cassation noted the following: she had undergone political training in a pkk camp in bekaa (syria); she had had four conversations with the head of a clan in south-eastern turkey, advising him not to prevent the pkk from attacking state targets and encouraging him to telephone the head of the pkk, addressing him as \u201cmr secretary general\u201d; she had twice visited the head of another clan to encourage him to join the pkk to help found kurdistan; she had handed over to the pkk one of its opponents who had been abducted by pkk militants; she had described slogans such as \u201clong live apo [apo is a diminutive used to refer to abdullah \u00f6calan, the head of the pkk]\u201d or \u201clong live kurdistan\u201d, shouted at a demonstration in cizre, as \u201cslogans of the kurdish people\u201d; she had declared on german television that she felt like a foreigner in turkey and that the turkish parliament, of which she was a member, was constantly taking decisions whose aim was to wipe out the kurdish people; and she had taken part in a demonstration and a press conference held by the pkk in brussels and had addressed the participants from a rostrum draped with the pkk flag. 26.  regarding orhan do\u011fan, the court of cassation noted the following: he had knowingly harboured a pkk militant in his home owing to his organic links with the pkk; he had helped the militant in question to obtain medical treatment and had fraudulently had the costs reimbursed by the national assembly; he had harboured four other pkk militants who were about to return to the organisation\u2019s camps; he had made statements to foreign embassies to the effect that the villagers leaving \u015firnak in august 1992 were actually fleeing the state forces; and he had stated at demonstrations that the turkish state was repressing the kurdish people in various ways, while describing the pkk as an army. 27.  regarding hatip dicle, the court of cassation noted the following: he had put pressure on the head of a clan in south-eastern turkey to join the pkk, whose aims he had said were to found kurdistan and destroy the enemy; he had asked the persons attending a public meeting in diyarbak\u0131r to observe a minute\u2019s silence in honour of the pkk\u2019s dead, asserting that the turkish army had come to the region to repress the kurdish people; he had stated in an interview given to a belgian daily newspaper that the kurds\u2019 ideal would be to found a kurdish state and that they had been fighting for their freedom since the treaty of lausanne (1923); he had described the pkk as a movement with popular roots; he had stated that all those who were against the kurds should be expelled from their territory even if that would cost them their lives; he had said that the kurds were engaged in an armed resistance to ensure their survival and that the alleged fight against terrorism amounted to an attempt to crush the kurds\u2019 claims to nationhood; he had attempted to justify the terrorist attack on the cadets of the military college for infantry conscripts, in which four people were killed and twenty injured, by saying that everyone in uniform was a potential target by virtue of the international conventions on the laws of war; and he had stated at a meeting of his party that the state could not solve the kurdish problem by banning the pkk. 28.  lastly, regarding selim sadak, the court of cassation found the following facts established: he had put pressure on the head of a clan in south-eastern turkey to accept the authority of the pkk; he had asked the inhabitants of the village of \u015fenoba (in south-east turkey) to relinquish their positions as village guards, explaining that they were in kurdistan and that the kurdish war of national liberation was soon to be launched against the fascist turkish state; he had described police officers escorting persons in police custody on suspicion of having been active within the pkk as torturers, while stating that he would prevent the repression of the kurds by the turks and that the kurds would demand some form of retribution; at a meeting held by the pkk in neuch\u00e2tel (switzerland), he had described the pkk as a guerrilla army fighting for the independence of kurdistan and the kurdish people; and in a communiqu\u00e9 sent to foreign embassies in turkey he had declared that the villagers leaving \u015firnak in august 1992 had in fact been fleeing the state forces.", "labels": ["14", "10", "11", "6"]}
{"text": "7.  the circumstances in which the applicant\u2019s brother disappeared are disputed. in accordance with former article 28 \u00a7 1 (a) of the convention, the commission conducted an

to 22 september 1999 in ankara. they also visited the offices of the anti-terrorist branch at ankara security directorate on 20 september 1999. evidence was taken from the following witnesses: the applicant, eleven people who had been in custody at the material time at ankara security directorate and who alleged that they had met kenan bilgin there and had witnessed the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected, two public prosecutors who had investigated the case, a deputy director at ankara security directorate and a police officer from the anti-terrorist branch at ankara security directorate. 8.  at 10 a.m. on 12 september 1994 the applicant\u2019s brother, kenan bilgin, was arrested at a taxi rank in dikmen (ankara) by plainclothes police officers. his family was not informed. 9.  the applicant received three anonymous telephone calls from someone who confirmed that his brother was being held at g\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 (ankara) with three other prisoners. he was told that his brother\u2019s condition was serious and that he was being administered serum. during the last conversation, which took place on 15 november 1994, the caller said that the applicant\u2019s brother had been moved elsewhere. 10.  on 3 october 1994 kenan bilgin\u2019s lawyer, ms hatipo\u011flu, contacted the human rights commission of the turkish national assembly. she and two other lawyers also made a written statement to the press. 11.  by an undated letter the applicant requested information from the principal public prosecutor at the ankara national security court about his brother\u2019s health, indicating that his brother had been arrested on 11 september 1994. on 4 october 1994 a similar request was made to the principal public prosecutor by ms hatipo\u011flu, who put the date of the arrest at 13 september 1994. 12.  in his letters in reply dated 10 october 1994 the principal public prosecutor said that no one by the name of kenan bilgin had been interviewed and that no warrant had been issued for his arrest. 13.  on 10 october 1994 the applicant made a written statement to the press. the same day, his representatives contacted the ankara branch of the human rights association about his brother\u2019s case. on 11 october 1994 the association issued an appeal to the provincial governor of ankara for kenan bilgin to be brought before the public prosecutor, while the applicant managed to obtain written statements signed by ten prisoners who had also been held at ankara security directorate between 12 and 27 september 1994, in which they confirmed that kenan bilgin had been held there between those dates and subjected to ill-treatment. 14.  on 12 october 1994 ms hatipo\u011flu wrote to the principal public prosecutor at the ankara national security court to enquire what had become of kenan bilgin. she explained that although several witnesses affirmed that they had seen him in police custody, the police denied that he had been detained. 15.  on 9 november 1994 the applicant lodged a complaint with the ankara public prosecutor against the officers who had been on duty while his brother was in custody, namely police officers from the anti-terrorist branch at the ankara security directorate. inter alia, he gave the names of witnesses who had testified that kenan bilgin had been held in the same building as them. 16.  furthermore, at a hearing on 21 november 1994 in criminal proceedings before the ankara national security court, one of the defendants, whose name was mr y\u0131lmaz, testified to having met kenan bilgin at the ankara security directorate. another defendant, mr \u00e7oban, said in evidence before the court that police officers had threatened him, telling him that unless he made a confession he would meet the same fate as kenan bilgin. 17.  when making a bail application to the ankara national security court on 1 february 1995, a lawyer, mr demir, said that while he and kenan bilgin were in custody together they had spoken and kenan bilgin had told him that he had been held for twenty-two days and that the police intended to arrange for his disappearance. kenan bilgin had also asked mr demir to inform his family. 18.  the government\u2019s position was that while it was true that kenan bilgin was a member of the revolutionary communist party of turkey (tdkp), he was not wanted by the police and had not been arrested by the security forces. as the ankara public prosecutor had stated in a letter of 23 december 1994 to the ministry of justice, the custody records showed that kenan bilgin had not been arrested or detained. 19.  in a statement made on 3 or 4 october 1994, a lawyer, murat demir, said that he had spoken with kenan bilgin, who had informed him that he had been in custody for twenty-two days and that his name had not been entered on the custody record.\nercan akta\u015f stated that prisoners in custody in the offices of the anti-terrorist branch

i\u0307kiz akdemir stated that while being held in custody between 13 and 25 september 1994 she had heard someone call out: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin! i was taken into custody on 12 september and they want to arrange for me to disappear.\u201d according to her, the prisoner she had seen through the cell-door window was kenan bilgin. he had difficulty walking and his body bore marks of torture.\n\u00f6zer akdemir stated that he had been held from 12 to 25 september 1994 in the offices of the anti-terrorist branch at the ankara security directorate. during that period all the prisoners had been systematically subjected to torture. he had been in cell no. 6. the prisoner in cell no. 8 was subjected to severe ill-treatment every day. he was taken away naked for torture sessions and dragged back to his cell afterwards. he saw him through an aperture in the cell-door window. the four people who took the prisoner away for interrogation were the same four people who had interrogated him, so he would have no difficulty in recognising them. one day, the prisoner from cell no. 8 cried out from the toilets where he had been taken: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin. they want to arrange for me to disappear! my name is not on the custody record.\u201d he had been brought back to cell no. 8 later.\n(b)  complaints lodged by the applicant with the public prosecutor at the ankara national security court on 4 and 12 october 1994 and petition by the ankara human rights association to the provincial governor\u2019s office and the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate on 11 october 1994 20.  the applicant alleged that his brother had been arrested on 11 september 1994 and that eyewitnesses had seen him in custody. he requested information about his brother\u2019s fate. his brother\u2019s lawyer made a similar request alleging that kenan bilgin had been taken into custody by police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate on 13 september 1994.\nin its petition the ankara human rights association gave the names of the eyewitnesses who had seen kenan bilgin at the ankara security directorate.\n(c)  documents relating to the investigation by the ankara public prosecutor 21.  in a letter of 21 november 1994 referring to the complaints lodged by the applicant\u2019s representatives, the ankara public prosecutor, selahattin kemalo\u011flu, instructed the public prosecutor\u2019s office at pendik (istanbul) to question the applicant about the matters raised. he also instructed the ankara security directorate to start an investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations. 22.  on 24 november 1994 the ministry of the interior informed the ministry of foreign affairs that the security directorate had advised that kenan bilgin had not been taken into custody, his name had not been entered on the custody record and he was not wanted by the police. 23.  on 9 december 1994 the deputy director at the security directorate, \u00fclk\u00fc met, sent a letter to the ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office, the relevant parts of which read: \n\u201c... between 12 september and 21 november 1994 the anti-terrorist branch carried out 249 arrests. of those arrested, 115 were brought before the principal public prosecutor at the national security court and the remaining 134 released. in addition on 16 and 17 october 1994 the committee for the prevention of torture carried out two ad hoc visits to the security directorate. they did not report any case of unlawful detention there ... in the interests of an effective investigation, persons remanded in custody, whether members of the same or of different organisations, never see each other unless a confrontation becomes necessary. even for the purposes of answering a call of nature, remand prisoners are taken to the toilets individually and are accompanied by a warder. furthermore, members of the same organisation are put in cells that are far apart from each other ... the sole aim of the persons whose names appear in the complaint and who claim to have seen the person known as kenan bilgin is to mislead the judicial authorities, to discredit the police and to obstruct the operations being carried out against illegal organisations ... the turkish police are proud of their 149-year history. certain people seek to destroy the democratic secular republic; they commit crimes, arguing that such unlawful acts are legitimate, and make allegations such as the present one to discredit the police and the state.\u201d 24.  on 23 december 1994 the ankara public prosecutor, nazmi \u015farvan, informed the ministry of justice that, while it was true that an investigation had been started into the affairs of members of the tdkp, kenan bilgin\u2019s name did not appear on the list of its members. 25.  on 13 january 1995 the ankara principal public prosecutor, \u00f6zden t\u00f6n\u00fck, sent a letter to the ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office, which was in charge of the investigation. the relevant parts of the letter read:\n\u201cthe committee for the prevention of torture (cpt) interviewed prisoners in ankara prison who had been transferred from the anti-terrorist branch at the security directorate and who said that they had seen kenan bilgin in september 1994 in the building where remand prisoners are detained. when we spoke to them, they said that they had seen kenan bilgin between 13 and 25 september 1994 through an aperture in their cell-door windows when he was being taken to the toilets, to the torture room or to be photographed. the investigation reveals that the section of the premises where remand prisoners are held contains individual cells with windows in the cell door that enable police officers to communicate with the prisoners or to pass them their food and which can only be opened from the outside by the warders. the cells are aired by a ventilator attached to the ceiling and it is impossible for prisoners to see what is happening outside. prisoners are interrogated on the floor above in an interview room that complies with european standards. the cells are not numbered but a small sheet of paper bearing the prisoner\u2019s name is attached to the cell door. persons arrested are photographed and fingerprinted by the technical services at the security directorate. between 1 january and 31 december 1994, 771 people were taken into custody at the anti-terrorist branch of the security directorate; of these, 160 were released by the police, 574 brought before a judge and 37 transferred to other branches at the security directorate. thus, with the exception of kenan bilgin, there had been no complaints of any disappearances of prisoners being held in custody. according to the inquiry conducted by the cpt on 16 and 17 october 1994, in an unannounced visit to the security directorate, there are no reports of unlawful detention on the premises. considering that the purported witnesses did not know either kenan bilgin or his family and that the security directorate state that his name was not on the custody record, it can safely be deduced that the allegations of the prisoners regarding the disappearance of the person known as kenan bilgin while in custody at the security directorate were aimed at misleading public opinion and harming the police as they attempted to mount operations against the illegal organisations.\u201d 26.  on 17 march 1995 the public prosecutor selahattin kemalo\u011flu took witness statements from cavit nacitarhan, \u00f6zer akdemir, salman maz\u0131, murat demir and m\u00fcjdat y\u0131lmaz, who were all accused of being members of an illegal extreme left-wing organisation, the tdkp. the following depositions were taken.\n(a)  cavit nacitarhan: \u201ci was arrested on 12 september 1994 and remained in custody for twenty-four days. i did not know kenan bilgin. however, after my second day in custody i saw him every day. he would cry out: \u2018my name is kenan bilgin, i have been in custody since 12 september and my name has not been entered on the records; if anyone is released, please inform the press, lawyers and human rights [associations] about my case.\u2019 i do not know why he was arrested but i saw him over a period of twenty-one days. he was dressed only in his underpants. he did not have the strength to stand unaided and had to be supported by two people. after my release, i saw his photograph in newspaper articles about his disappearance and that is how i recognised him.\u201d\n(b)  \u00f6zer akdemir: \u201ci was taken into custody on 26 september 1994. i did not know kenan bilgin, but i saw him three times at the security directorate. he was dressed only in his underpants. i was in cell no. 6 and he was in cell no. 8. when he was taken to the toilets, he would cry out: \u2018my name is kenan bilgin. they want to arrange for me to disappear. my name has not been entered on the custody records.\u2019 later, he was taken from his cell. that is all i witnessed. [i] certify that the signature on the written statement made on 16 or 17 september 1994 is mine.\u201d\n(c)  salman maz\u0131: \u201ci certify that i signed the written statement dated 11 october 1994. when i was in custody at the offices of the anti-terrorist branch at the security directorate between 12 and 25 september 1994, i saw kenan bilgin on several occasions. at one stage, i noticed that he was being dragged by his arm to the toilets in his underpants. he was often taken for interrogation and was severely tortured. he was in cell no. 8. on the eighth day i saw him in the toilets. he said to me in a weak voice: \u2018my name is kenan bilgin, i was arrested on 12 september at dikmen. my name has still not been entered on the records. they are probably going to arrange for me to disappear. if you get out of here, contact the public prosecutor\u2019s office and inform the press.\u2019 the warder then appeared and reprimanded him for having spoken to me, before taking him away. later i recognised his photograph in the newspapers.\u201d\n(d)  murat demir: \u201ci was taken into custody on 10 september 1994 and was put in cell no. 11. kenan bilgin was in no. 13 or 14. i did not know him. we were severely tortured. the remand prisoner in no. 13 stopped me and, as i was known as \u2018the lawyer\u2019, asked me if i really was a lawyer. he gave me his name and continued: \u2018i have been here for twenty-two days. my name has not been entered on the records. they probably want to arrange for me to disappear. i worked at a printer\u2019s. if you are brought before a judge, tell the lawyers that i am here.\u2019 he too was tortured. i heard the sounds of torture and groans. i certify that the signature on the written statement is mine and confirm the content. i saw his photograph in the newspapers later. however, he seemed far more exhausted and tired [in custody].\u201d\n(e)  m\u00fcjdat y\u0131lmaz: \u201ci confirm the content of the written statement of 11 october 1994. i do not know kenan bilgin, but i saw him on two or three occasions. i was in cell no. 2. i saw him being taken to the toilets by his torturers and heard him call out: \u2018my name is kenan bilgin. they want to arrange for me to disappear.\u2019 i saw him like that three times. i am able to recognise these men [the police officers] because they also undressed my wife before my eyes. one of them was smaller than me, approximately 1.80 m tall with a receding hairline and was called \u2018boss\u2019 by the others. he was one of the men who took kenan bilgin away. i would recognise him without any hesitation. i made a statement to the public prosecutor who came to the prison.\u201d 27.  referring to the statements of these witnesses, the public prosecutor selahattin kemalo\u011flu enquired of the ankara principal public prosecutor whether an investigation had been started following the allegations that kenan bilgin had been tortured and had disappeared after being taken into custody in the offices of the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate. 28.  on the instructions of the public prosecutor selahattin kemalo\u011flu, two police officers from the security directorate at \u00fcsk\u00fcdar (istanbul) took a statement from the applicant on 5 april 1994. the applicant stated that a cousin had informed him that his brother had been arrested in ankara on 12 september 1994. he and his brothers had gone to the offices of the ankara human rights association, had consulted lawyers and had learnt that certain prisoners had claimed that kenan bilgin had been in custody in the same building as them but had not been brought before a judge for an order to be made for his detention pending trial. 29.  on 16 september 1995 the applicant had given a statement at k\u0131s\u0131kl\u0131 (istanbul) police station. he said that he had lodged a complaint with the ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office and had given the names of witnesses who said that they had seen kenan bilgin in the offices of the anti-terrorist branch at the security directorate. he had repeated his allegations and asked for news of his brother. 30.  by a letter of 27 december 1995 in which he referred to the applicant\u2019s complaint and statement, the public prosecutor selahattin kemalo\u011flu requested the pertek (tunceli) public prosecutor\u2019s office for the locality where the register of births of the bilgin family was held to conduct an investigation into the alleged disappearance of kenan bilgin, and in so doing to have regard to the possibility that he may have taken part in pkk (workers\u2019 party of kurdistan) activities. he added that the security directorate considered the allegations of the applicant and his lawyers regarding the alleged disappearance at the hands of the police to be an attempt to damage the police\u2019s reputation. 31.  by letters of 9 october and 27 november 1996 the pertek public prosecutor instructed the district gendarmerie to make enquiries of the people with whom kenan bilgin was in close contact in order to establish whether he had joined the ranks of the pkk. 32.  on 3 december 1996 the gendarmes took a statement from someone who lived in the village in which kenan bilgin was born. he said that the bilgin family had left the village forty years earlier and that he did not know whether kenan bilgin was a member of the pkk. 33.  on 9 july 1997 the public prosecutor selahattin kemalo\u011flu instructed the ankara security directorate to carry out a search for kenan bilgin. the relevant part of his letter reads as follows.\n\u201can investigation has been carried out into allegations by i\u0307rfan bilgin that his brother, who was arrested on 12 september 1994 at dikimevi (ankara), was taken into custody in the offices of the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate, that he was seen by other prisoners but has given no signs of life since. other enquiries have been made into the possibility that kenan bilgin belongs to the pkk organisation or that attempts have been made to damage the police\u2019s reputation, and enquiries have been made of the authorities of the village where he was born and in the locality where he resides. however, it is not been possible to reach any conclusion in this case.\n\u201ci wish to request your department to start an investigation into every eventuality, namely whether kenan bilgin disappeared while in police custody, or whether he has joined the ranks of the pkk or has been hiding in secret in turkey and has in fact been used by people close to him with a view to damaging the reputation of the police. i should be grateful if you would then inform me of the result of your findings.\u201d\n(d)  the findings of the delegates of the commission on their visit to the ankara security directorate on 20 september 1999 34.  the delegation visited the premises in which prisoners were held at the offices of the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate. it was informed that alterations had been made to the layout of the cells on the ground floor at the end of 1994. there were now thirteen cells (three cells having been converted into a single cell) running along one side of a long, narrow corridor. the delegation found an empty room at the end of that corridor, with a small corridor leading off to the adjoining toilets. the prisoners\u2019 names and numbers were written on cards inserted into slots above the doors with the reverse side facing outwards. the police officer in charge of the premises said: \u201cprisoners have no possibility of seeing or speaking to each other and their movements in the premises are made in accordance with official regulations. dishes are passed directly through the door with the prisoners being required to stand back. the police officer in charge of the premises where prisoners are held has a list of the people in custody and of the cell numbers, and prisoners do not change cells while in custody.\u201d the delegation carried out two experiments on the premises.\n(i)  two delegates were shut in two adjoining cells. one said his name out loud. he was heard by the other and by the group in the corridor.\n(ii)  a delegate was shut in a cell and a lawyer from the delegation in a cell two doors away. in order to establish what they could hear, they were asked to speak in their cells. the lawyer heard the delegate\u2019s voice but said that the noise from the ventilation system prevented him from making out what he said.\nthe delegation then visited the interrogation room on the first floor.\n(e)  the custody records 35.  the name kenan bilgin does not appear on the custody records at the ankara security directorate. the records show that several people were arrested and taken into custody at the directorate between 8 and 29 september 1994, including b\u00fclent kat and talat abay on 8 september, salman maz\u0131, m\u00fcjdat y\u0131lmaz and emine \u00f6\u011f\u00fcn on 12 september, sahir \u00e7oban, ayse nur i\u0307kiz akdemir, \u00f6zer akdemir and ercan akta\u015f on 13 september, murat demir on 27 september, and cavit nacitarhan on 25 september. 36.  on 17 september in strasbourg and between 20 and 22 september 1999 in ankara, three commission delegates took the following depositions.\n(a)  i\u0307rfan bilgin 37.  i\u0307rfan bilgin is the applicant and kenan bilgin\u2019s brother. he said that his brother had been arrested on 12 september 1994 at dikmen (ankara) and that he had been informed of the arrest approximately twenty days later.\nhis brother had been arrested as part of an operation that had been carried out by the security forces in different localities on the same day against members of the revolutionary movement. 38.   kenan bilgin had previously been in custody in 1977 and had spent three years in prison. he had been a member of the revolutionary movement since 1976 and had been on the police\u2019s wanted list. in 1993 he had been arrested at gaziantep (a town in south-east turkey) in possession of false identity papers. he had been held for twenty-five days and severely tortured. he had told his family that the police had made threats on releasing him, warning him: \u201cthis time, you are safe, you have escaped with your life, but the next time we catch you, you will not leave here alive.\u201d 39.  the applicant said that following his brother\u2019s disappearance he had received two or three telephone calls from one co\u015fkun, who had informed him that his brother was being held at g\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131 (ankara) and subjected to torture. he was in very poor shape and on a drip. 40.  the applicant said that he had contacted people who claimed to have been held on the same premises as kenan bilgin. after speaking to them, he had lodged applications with the ministry of the interior, the national security court, the secretary of state for human rights and the security directorate. however, despite the evidence of several prisoners, those authorities had denied that his brother had ever been in custody. 41.  the applicant said that he had lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor\u2019s office. however, he was unaware whether an investigation had been started. he had been required to attend the offices of the anti-terrorist branch at the istanbul security directorate either once or twice and had repeated his allegations.\n(b)  murat demir 42.  the witness is a lawyer who currently lives in germany, where he has been granted political asylum. he said that he was arrested by police officers from the ankara security directorate in his office on 27 september 1994 and held by the anti-terrorist branch for thirteen days. he was detained in a small cell and had changed cells on three or four occasions. 43.  he gave the following description of the premises where prisoners were held. the cells were not numbered and ran the length of one side of a corridor. on the other side of the corridor was a room used for torture, toilets, a bathroom that was also used for torture, the warders\u2019 office and two other cells that were larger and better furnished than the others. the doors were equipped with small windows, approximately 20 to 30 cm across, through which the prisoners could be observed. both the windows and the cell doors were opened from time to time by the warders. by pressing his head firmly against the aperture in the cell-door window, he was able to see what was going on outside and had thus seen the other prisoners when they were taken away to be tortured. 44.  when first taken into custody he had been put in a cell between the toilets and the bathroom that doubled up as a torture chamber. the prisoner in the cell next door was a university lecturer. the witness said that he had heard groans coming from the cell next to the lecturer\u2019s. he explained that he was systematically tortured and that one evening, at the end of the torture session and after he had been taken back to his cell, the prisoner, who was groaning and was in very poor shape had said to him: \u201ci have been detained for twenty-two days. my name is kenan bilgin. you are the lawyer of a close relative of mine, h\u00fcseyin \u00f6zaslan, who is currently being held in ankara prison. my name has not been entered on the custody records. they are going to arrange for me to disappear. could you inform my family and the lawyers that i have been detained?\u201d on hearing this, the witness had tried to reassure the man, saying that he now had an eyewitness to his detention and that he could no longer be regarded as having disappeared. a few days later, on returning to his cell after another torture session that had lasted all night, he noticed that all the prisoners had changed cells. he had not see kenan bilgin again. 45.  the witness said that detention in police cells was not always entered on the custody record and that the police officers used that practice as a form of torture. he had heard them tell certain prisoners in custody: \u201cwe have not entered your name on the custody record. we can do as we please with you.\u201d 46.  he said that he did not know kenan bilgin personally. kenan bilgin\u2019s lawyer, ms hatipo\u011flu, had asked him while visiting the prison whether he had met kenan bilgin at the police station and he had informed her of their conversation.\n(c)  cavit nacitarhan 47.  cavit nacitarhan said that he had been arrested on 12 september 1994 by the police for being a member of an illegal organisation, the tdkp. he had been held in custody for twenty-four days. for eighteen or nineteen days he had been taken for interrogation twice daily at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. during the interrogation sessions he had been systematically tortured. for the remainder of his time in custody he had been given medical attention to remove the marks left by the injuries on his body. 48.  he described the events following his arrest as follows: he had firstly been taken to a place called g\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, where the police officers had threatened to kill him unless he cooperated with them; he had been interrogated there before being taken to the ankara security directorate. 49.  the witness gave the names of other people who had been in custody during the same period. he said that he had learnt their names following a confrontation that had been organised with them or after meeting some of them in the prison. he had heard kenan bilgin\u2019s name while in police custody. 50.  he related how, in general, prisoners were taken to the toilets in groups of four or five. however, that did not apply to certain prisoners, including himself and another prisoner. they were only allowed to leave their cells to go to the toilet when the doors of the other cells had been shut. prisoners\u2019 names, apart from his own and that of another prisoner who he later discovered was kenan bilgin, were written on small cards that were fastened to the cell doors. on seeing kenan bilgin\u2019s photographs in the press, he had immediately realised that it was the same person. one day, when all the cells were closed, he had attempted to see what was going on in the corridor by looking through a small aperture next to the cell-door window. although his angle of view had been very restricted, he had been able to make out two police officers leading a nearly naked prisoner whose eyes were blindfolded. the prisoner had been taken back to his cell many hours later. he had seen him several times being dragged across the floor to or from his cell. 51.  a few days later he had heard a prisoner saying: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin. my name has not been entered on the custody record. please inform my family and public opinion about my case.\u201d he had heard the same person cry out several times from the bathroom that had been converted into a torture chamber. the man had been asked repeatedly: \u201cwhat is your name? tell us your name. do not shout.\u201d 52.  on 26 september a confrontation had been organised with other prisoners who had been arrested as part of the same operation. kenan bilgin was not among them. on 3 october 1994 the witness had again seen kenan bilgin being led away by police officers. he was in very poor shape. that same evening there seemed to be a panic and the doors had remained closed throughout the evening. police officers were running in all directions. since that day, he had not seen kenan bilgin again. in his opinion, kenan bilgin was executed on 3 october. 53.  the witness said that the applicant had visited him in prison in 1996 and that was how he had informed him of the date he was taken into custody. they had had a very short discussion about kenan bilgin. he said that he had sent a written statement through his representatives certifying that kenan bilgin had been present at the ankara security directorate. 54.  according to the witness, although he had been taken into custody on 12 september 1994, his detention had not been recorded until 26 september 1994, after his admission to hospital. he had informed the public prosecutor of that fact but the public prosecutor had merely accepted the police officers\u2019 account.\n(d)  b\u00fclent kat 55.  b\u00fclent kat said that he had been arrested on 8 september 1994 with two other people and had remained in custody in the offices of the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate for fifteen days. when first detained, three or four prisoners were being held; a week later, their number had risen to approximately fifty. 56.  the first prisoner he noticed was cavit nacitarhan, who was the nephew of a member of parliament and occupied the cell next to his. the police officers had began the torture sessions with cavit, whose body was swollen and covered in bruises and who had difficulty walking. the witness had a clear view of prisoners being taken to the torture chamber, which was diagonally opposite his cell. 57.  he related how, after cavit nacitarhan was interrogated, it was the turn of another prisoner to suffer the same treatment. the question he heard most often was: \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d the prisoner\u2019s cries had turned into grunts and groans. the last time he had seen him brought by a group of police officers for a torture session, either on 18 or 19 september, was identical to the others: the same groans, the same question, the same insults, the same cries. the witness went on: \u201csuddenly, there was total silence. the police officers came out of the torture chamber and a man carrying a black bag went inside. he looked like a doctor, but was probably from the police. they brought the prisoner out, dragging him behind them.\u201d 58.  the witness said that the warders opened the windows in their cell doors from time to time to give them bread or water. however, the aperture in the windows to the cells of cavit nacitarhan and the prisoner referred to above were kept shut. 59.  he said that he did not know kenan bilgin before his arrest and had identified him from photographs in the press. 60.  in practice, detention at the anti-terrorist branch was not entered on the records on the day the prisoner was taken into custody. the practice depended on how the interrogation proceeded. 61.  the witness repeated that kenan bilgin had been on the same premises as him for at least fifteen days and had been tortured throughout that period. 62.  he stated that he had signed a statement on 11 october 1994 as testimony for the benefit of public opinion and had made a statement to the public prosecutor.\n(e)  talat abay 63.  talat abay said that he had been arrested on 8 september 1994 as a member of an illegal organisation, rizgari, and had been held in custody for fifteen days at the ankara security directorate. on 12 september a number of people had been taken into custody and all the cells were occupied. while in custody, prisoners were systematically subjected to torture. 64.  he had known kenan bilgin before september 1994, as he had stayed at the witness\u2019s home for almost two years in 1985 and 1986. 65.  he had seen kenan bilgin on the night of 18 or 19 september 1994, when he was taken to the toilet. they had made eye contact but had not spoken. 66.  the witness said that he had made a written statement confirming that kenan bilgin had been held in custody. in addition, he added that at his trial before the national security court he had testified to meeting kenan bilgin at the ankara security directorate.\n(f)  ercan akta\u015f 67.  the witness, who was a student at the material time, had been held in custody from 13 to 27 september 1994, for being a member of the pkk. 68.  as he had said in his written statement, he and the other prisoners had been systematically taken for torture sessions. the torture chamber was near his cell. for several nights another prisoner had been taken to the torture chamber after him. he was always asked the same question, \u201cwhat is your name?\u201d, and he had heard cries and groans. he had seen him once, through an aperture in the cell-door window, for five or six seconds, from the front and distinctly, being supported by two police officers. the prisoner could not walk without assistance and dragged his feet. the witness had subsequently learnt, after being transferred to prison, that the prisoner\u2019s name was kenan bilgin. 69.  the witness said that he had no difficulty in being certain that the prisoner who had groaned and cried out in agony was kenan bilgin, since he had seen almost all of the other prisoners in prison. 70.  the police officers would accompany them to the toilet and when they washed their hands and faces in the wash basins, they had an opportunity of meeting other prisoners.\n(g)  sahir \u00e7oban 71.  sahir \u00e7oban accompanied the delegates when they visited the offices of the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate. 72.  at the material time he was a teacher. he had been arrested by the police on 12 september 1994 in the village where he taught for aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. he had been detained at the ankara security directorate on 13 september 1994. 73.  the witness reported his findings concerning the premises visited by the delegates of the commission. the premises had been altered. the cells had been ventilated through the open cell-door windows, there being no ventilation through the ceiling. the room where the custody records were made up had been at what was now the entrance. the cells had been smaller and closer together and there had been additional cells along another corridor. the witness had been held in one of those cells and had remained there for approximately seven days. on the second or third day of his detention, he had been able to make out, through the open window in his cell door, two other prisoners in cells diagonally opposite his own, approximately three metres away. he did not know kenan bilgin before his arrest. he had seen his photograph in the offices of the human rights association. he had made a statement that he had seen him in custody at the security directorate and had agreed to give evidence to that effect. 74.  after making his statement he had been intimidated, in the presence of his wife, by a police officer who had visited him at the school where he taught. the police officer had made threats such as: \u201cyou eat from the state\u2019s plate. i will not allow you to dirty that plate. you will suffer the same fate as kenan bilgin.\u201d he added that, despite the threats, he had deposed before the national security court in november 1994.\n(h)  m\u00fcjdat y\u0131lmaz 75.  m\u00fcjdat y\u0131lmaz said that he had been accused of being a member of the tdkp. he had been arrested on 12 september 1994 and had remained in custody until 26 september 1994. 76.  as his two closest relatives had also been detained on the same premises, he had endeavoured to keep watch through an aperture in the cell-door window to see what was happening in the corridor. on 16 or 17 september he had seen a prisoner in the toilets, with his back to the wall. the prisoner was exhausted and did not have the strength to remain upright. he was being insulted and pulled backwards by his hair. the witness had seen the same prisoner on another occasion, in similar circumstances, being dragged along by police officers. on the third occasion he saw him, the prisoner was in very poor shape and incapable of standing up. he had cried out: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin. i am registered at tunceli. the police want to kill me. when you get out of here, inform public opinion about my case.\u201d the officers in charge had prevented him from saying any more by taking hold of him by his hair and hitting him. after being transferred to prison, the witness had learnt that the prisoner concerned was called kenan bilgin. 77.  the witness said that it was possible to communicate from one cell to another by raising one\u2019s voice and that he had thus been able to converse from time to time with his niece. 78.  in addition to his written statement he had made a deposition in prison in which he had stated that he could identify the police officers who had dragged kenan bilgin back to his cell. the same officers had undressed his wife before his eyes and he was certain he would recognise them.\n(i)  salman maz\u0131 79.  salman maz\u0131 said that he had been arrested for aiding and abetting the tdkp and held in custody from 12 to 26 september 1994. 80.  he had seen kenan bilgin in person three times and for almost fifteen days had heard his groans when he was taken away for interrogation. 81.  two prisoners were treated differently from the others. one was cavit nacitarhan. they were taken separately to the toilet, being dragged there by their arms by two police officers. on his eighth day in custody, while the witness was washing his hands in the washroom, one of the two prisoners had been brought there. he looked exhausted and had whispered: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin. i was taken into custody on 12 september and my name has still not been entered on the record. i think they want to kill me or to arrange for me to disappear. inform public opinion about my case.\u201d the warder had intervened and dragged him back to his cell. he had seen him a second time, lying on his bed in his cell opposite the toilets in his underpants. a day or two later, he had seen him through the window in his cell door. he was being dragged away. 82.  the witness affirmed that he had heard kenan bilgin cry out from his cell, giving his surname, first name and the name of the province from which he came.\n(j)  emine \u00f6\u011f\u00fcn 83.  emine \u00f6\u011f\u00fcn said that she had been arrested with her husband on 12 september 1994 for being a member of an illegal organisation and had remained in custody until 25 september 1994. 84.  two days before her release, when asking for water through the window in her cell door, she had seen a prisoner in a bad condition who had said to her: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin. i was taken into custody on 12 september.\u201d\n(k)  ay\u015fe nur i\u0307kiz akdemir 85.  ay\u015fe nur i\u0307kiz akdemir said that she had been arrested on 12 september 1994 at \u00e7anakkale. she had been detained at the ankara security directorate from 13 to 25 september. 86.  she affirmed that she had heard someone cry out \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin\u201d, and had caught a glimpse, through her cell window, of a dark man, bald and with a moustache, whom she had later identified as kenan bilgin. 87.  the witness said that the public prosecutor had taken a statement from her in prison and had asked her to describe the circumstances in which she had seen kenan bilgin. \n(l)  \u00f6zer akdemir 88.  \u00f6zer akdemir said that he had been arrested on 12 september 1994 for being a member of an illegal organisation and had remained in custody until 25 september. 89.  he had been systematically subjected to torture while in detention. he had been able to see through an aperture in the cell-door window that the prisoner in cell no. 8 was subjected to more intensive torture then he. he had seen him being dragged along by four police officers, two of them supporting him by the arms. on the same date he had seen a person with a bag go into cell no. 8 and had heard someone say: \u201che is not taking any milk. he is not drinking any milk.\u201d on another occasion the witness had seen, again through the window in his cell door, the same prisoner being taken to the toilet. the prisoner had cried out: \u201cmy name is kenan bilgin. they want to arrange for me to disappear.\u201d 90.  the witness explained that in principle prisoners were not allowed to communicate with each other. however, they would either speak in whispers while at the wash basins or attempt to make themselves heard between cells. 91.  the witness affirmed that he had drafted his written statement in the prison where he was detained. he had been questioned about it by the public prosecutor .\n(m)  \u00f6zden t\u00f6n\u00fck 92.  \u00f6zden t\u00f6n\u00fck said that at the material time he had been the ankara principal public prosecutor, a position he still held. he had not been directly responsible for the investigation into the allegations concerning kenan bilgin\u2019s disappearance. his letter of 13 january 1995 to the ankara public prosecutor\u2019s office contained a description of the actual conditions of detention and of the quarters used for holding prisoners at the ankara security directorate. 93.  he had been to the security directorate and had inspected the premises. he had heard evidence from people who said that they had seen kenan bilgin in custody. without giving details, the witness affirmed that their statements were inconsistent. he declined to comment on the conclusion, which read: \u201caccordingly, it has been concluded that the statements of the persons held in custody were not true.\u201d 94.  the witness explained that he had drafted his report at the request of the ministry of justice and had not organised any confrontation between the prisoners who claimed to have seen kenan bilgin and the police officers present on the premises at the material time.\n(n)  selahattin kemalo\u011flu 95.  selahattin kemalo\u011flu said that at the material time he had been the ankara public prosecutor. he was now the public prosecutor for the district of elmada\u011f (ankara). 96.  the witness said that it had been another prosecutor, \u00f6zden t\u00f6n\u00fck, who had started the investigation into kenan bilgin\u2019s disappearance. the witness had been assigned to the case after a complaint was lodged by kenan bilgin\u2019s brother. 97.  he summarised his investigation as follows. he had sent a letter to the ankara security directorate enquiring whether kenan bilgin had been detained there. the police had replied that he had at no stage been in custody. he had taken evidence from the witnesses whose names had been supplied by i\u0307rfan bilgin and they had repeated their written statements, saying that they had seen kenan bilgin, in very poor shape, in custody at the ankara security directorate. after hearing that evidence he had become convinced that kenan bilgin had disappeared like many others. 98.  the witness went on to say: \u201cat the material time there had been a number of cases of disappearances and, as a prosecutor, i was very disturbed by this. on hearing the evidence of the witnesses, i realised that the information given by the police did not reflect the truth. i received no replies to the letters i sent to other police departments. i sent the documents from the investigation to the principal public prosecutor, \u00f6zden t\u00f6n\u00fck, with a request for the cases to be joined. however, the case file was returned to me. i asked the principal public prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings against the head of the security directorate under the laws that made it an offence to refuse to cooperate with the relevant prosecuting authorities, as he had failed to produce a list of the police officers on duty when the alleged offences were committed. as the authorities did not respond, i was unable to interview the police officers or to arrange a confrontation with the eyewitnesses. the police enjoyed a sort of immunity at the time. i was not able to visit the premises where the prisoners were detained.\u201d 99.  the witness explained that 12 september was a relatively sensitive date in turkey and that, at that time of the year, several thousand people were being held in police custody; some of them later disappeared. he said: \u201cat the material time we, the prosecutors, were unable to inspect prisons or police stations. during a visit to the security directorate, i heard certain noises and asked the police officers where they were coming from. they replied that they had recorded the sound of people crying out in pain with a view to subduing prisoners. with regard to the present case, i tried to investigate it to the best of my ability. i had strong suspicions but did not manage to get very far. i am of kurdish origin and my telephone line was being monitored. i was transferred to elmada\u011f (ankara), the district where i worked thirty years ago.\u201d\n(o)  mehmet karata\u015f 100.  mehmet karata\u015f said that at the material time he was a police officer with the anti-terrorist branch of the ankara security directorate. he was responsible for compiling the custody records. 101.  he described how the custody records were held. the following information was noted on them: the surname and first name of the accused; the surname and first names of the accused\u2019s mother and father; the accused\u2019s date of birth; and the date and time the accused was taken into custody. he said that it was impossible for the name of a person taken into custody to be omitted from the record and that he was under fairly strict instructions in that regard. he said that a custody report was sent every day to the departmental head and to the public prosecutor at the national security court. 102.  he indicated that the labels attached to the door handles were numbered and that the prisoners\u2019 names were written on other labels that were affixed to the cell doors. 103.  with regard to the complaint concerning kenan bilgin\u2019s disappearance, he had not been interviewed by the authorities and had not been the subject of any investigation. the witness was unable to say whether a prosecutor had inspected the premises in connection with the investigation. according to him, all the allegations of torture had been invented by certain movements hostile to the government and were totally unfounded. 104.  he said that before the events that had given rise to the present case kenan bilgin had been arrested for being a member of the tdkp. he had been charged and had served his sentence. he had also been taken into custody for other activities as a member of that illegal organisation. his name was on file and the anti-terrorist branch had his case file containing details of his criminal record and of his membership of an illegal organisation.\n(p)  \u00fclk\u00fc met 105.  \u00fclk\u00fc met said that at the material time he was deputy director at the ankara security directorate. 106.  he stated that after kenan bilgin\u2019s brother had lodged the complaint, the public prosecutor had begun an investigation and had made four or five written requests to the security directorate for information, but he had not inspected the premises. 107.  the witness stated that the operation carried out by the police against the tdkp between 12 september and 21 november 1994 was routine and had been undertaken on the basis of information and statements received. the police had relatively large numbers of files on persons who were in custody or had been convicted for belonging to illegal organisations. he said that kenan bilgin had not been arrested during the operation; his name was not on the custody record and, in his opinion, the other prisoners\u2019 claims that kenan bilgin had been detained at the security directorate had been concocted by militants. 108.  he explained that at all times at least two police officers were on duty with the responsibility of carrying out body searches on anyone who had been arrested, collecting their personal effects and getting them to sign a list setting these out. they were also required to enter the names of persons arrested on the custody record. 109.  the witness dismissed all allegations of ill-treatment or torture during custody and stated that, while he had been deputy director, the european committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (cpt) had carried out two ad hoc visits to the security directorate. he was, however, unable to comment on the two public statements made by the cpt, in which they had found: \u201ctorture and other forms of ill-treatment were still important characteristics of police custody.\u201d 110.  the witness rejected the assertion of the public prosecutor selahattin kemalo\u011flu that the security directorate had failed to cooperate with him and said that prosecutors in charge of investigations could inspect the premises at any time.", "labels": ["5", "2"]}
{"text": "11.  on 29 april 1962 the applicant married mr a. gigliozzi in a religious ceremony which was also valid in the eyes of the law (matrimonio concordatario). 12.  on 23 february 1987 the applicant petitioned the rome district court for judicial separation. 13.  in a judgment dated 2 october 1990 the district court granted her petition and also ordered mr gigliozzi to pay the applicant maintenance (mantenimento) of 300,000 italian lira per month. 14.  in the meantime, on 20 november 1987, the applicant was summoned to appear before the lazio regional ecclesiastical court of the rome vicariate on 1 december 1987 \u201cto answer questions in the gigliozzi-pellegrini matrimonial case\u201d. 15.  on 1 december 1987 the applicant went alone to the ecclesiastical court without knowing why she had been summoned to appear. she was informed that on 6 november 1987 her husband had sought to have the marriage annulled on the ground of consanguinity (the applicant\u2019s mother and mr gigliozzi\u2019s father being cousins). she was questioned by the judge and stated that she had known of her consanguineous relationship with mr gigliozzi but did not know whether, at the time of her marriage, the priest had requested a special dispensation (dispensatio). 16.  in a judgment delivered on 10 december 1987 and deposited with the registry on the same day, the ecclesiastical court annulled the marriage on the ground of consanguinity. the court had followed a summary procedure (praetermissis solemnitatibus processus ordinarii) under article 1688 of the code of canon law. that procedure is followed where, once the parties have been summoned to appear and the defensor vinculis (defender of the institution of marriage) has intervened, it is clear from an agreed document that there is a ground for annulling the marriage. 17.  on 12 december 1987 the applicant was notified by the registry of the ecclesiastical court that on 6 november 1987 the court had annulled the marriage on the ground of consanguinity. 18.  on 21 december 1987 the applicant lodged an appeal with the roman rota (romana rota) against the ecclesiastical court\u2019s judgment. she submitted first that she had never received a copy of the judgment in question and complained that the court had not heard her submissions until 1 december 1987, which was after it had delivered its judgment of 6 november 1987. the applicant also alleged a breach of her defence rights and of the adversarial principle on account of the fact that she had been summoned to appear before the ecclesiastical court without being informed in advance either of the application to have the marriage annulled or the reasons for that application. she had therefore not prepared any defence and, furthermore, had not been assisted by a lawyer. 19.  on 26 january 1988 the registry of the ecclesiastical court informed the applicant that there had been a clerical error in the notification sent to her on 12 december 1987 and that the judgment was dated 10 december 1987. 20.  on 3 february 1988 the defensor vinculis submitted observations to the effect that the applicant \u201chad acted correctly in appealing against the judgment\u201d (la convenuta aveva agito giustamente facendo appello contro la sentenza) of the lazio court. accordingly, in a summons of 9 march 1988 the reporting judge of the rota summoned the parties and the defensor vinculis to appear. 21.  on 10 march 1988 the applicant was informed that the rota would examine her appeal on 13 april 1988 and that she had twenty days in which to submit observations. on 29 march 1988 the applicant, who was still unassisted by a lawyer, submitted her observations, in which she complained, inter alia, that she had not had adequate time and facilities for the preparation of her defence. she gave details of the financial arrangements between herself and her ex-husband and stressed that the annulment of the marriage would have substantial repercussions on her ex-husband\u2019s obligation to pay her maintenance, which was her only source of income. 22.  in a judgment of 13 april 1988, which was deposited with the registry on 10 may 1988, the rota upheld the decision annulling the marriage on the ground of consanguinity. the applicant received only the operative provisions of the judgment, her request for a full copy of it having been refused. 23.  on 23 november 1988 the rota informed the applicant and her ex-husband that its judgment, which had become enforceable by a decision of the superior ecclesiastical review body, had been referred to the florence court of appeal for a declaration that it could be enforced under italian law (delibazione). 24.  on 25 september 1989 the applicant\u2019s ex-husband summoned her to appear before the florence court of appeal. 25.  the applicant appeared before that court and requested it to set aside the rota\u2019s judgment for infringing her defence rights. she stated that she had not received a copy of the application to have the marriage annulled and had been unable to examine the documents filed in the proceedings, including the observations of the defensor vinculis. she requested the court to refuse to declare the rota\u2019s judgment enforceable, submitting that, in any event, the proceedings would have to be reopened in order to allow her to examine and reply to the documents filed in the proceedings under canon law. she requested, in the alternative, in the event that the court should declare the judgment enforceable, that her ex-husband be ordered to pay her monthly maintenance for the rest of her life. 26.  in a judgment of 8 november 1991, deposited with the registry on 10 march 1992, the florence court of appeal declared the judgment of 13 april 1988 enforceable. the court found that the opportunity given to the applicant on 1 december 1987 to answer questions had been sufficient to ensure that the adversarial principle had been complied with and that, moreover, she had freely chosen to bring the proceedings before the rota and had been able to exercise her defence rights in those proceedings \u201cirrespective of the special features of proceedings under canon law\u201d. the court went on to hold that it did not have jurisdiction to award her maintenance \u201cfor the rest of her life\u201d; as far as a possible award of interim maintenance (assegno provvisorio) was concerned, which was a provisional arrangement, the court pointed out that the applicant had not in any event proved that she needed the money. 27.  the applicant appealed on points of law, repeating her submission that her defence rights had been infringed in the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts. she submitted, among other things, that the court of appeal had omitted to take account of the following features of the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts: the parties cannot be represented by a lawyer; the respondent is not informed of the reasons relied on by the petitioner for having the marriage annulled until he or she is questioned; the defensor vinculis, who acts as the respondent\u2019s guardian, is not obliged to lodge an appeal; an appeal must be lodged personally by the party in question and not by their lawyer; the ecclesiastical court is not particularly autonomous. she repeated that she had not been informed in detail of the application to have the marriage annulled or of the possibility of being assisted by a lawyer. furthermore, the proceedings at first instance had been too quick. the applicant also criticised the fact that the court of appeal appeared to have omitted to examine the case file relating to the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts, which might have yielded evidence in the applicant\u2019s favour. besides that, the applicant submitted that she had shown herself to be in financial need and was therefore entitled to maintenance. 28.  during the proceedings the applicant had requested the registry of the ecclesiastical court to give her a copy of the documents filed in the annulment proceedings in order to produce them before the court of cassation, but the court clerk had refused to grant her request on the ground that the parties could receive only the operative provisions of the judgment, \u201cwhich should be sufficient to allow them to exercise their defence rights\u201d. 29.  in a judgment of 10 march 1995, deposited with the registry on 21 june 1995, the court of cassation dismissed the appeal. it held, first of all, that the adversarial principle had been complied with in the proceedings before the ecclesiastical courts; moreover, there was case-law authority to support the view that while the assistance of a lawyer was not a requirement under canon law, it was not forbidden: the applicant could therefore have taken advantage of that possibility. the court also held that the fact that the applicant had had a very short time in which to prepare her defence in november 1987 did not amount to an infringement of her defence rights because she had not indicated why she had needed more time. with regard to the request for maintenance, the court of cassation held that the court of appeal could not have decided otherwise, given that the applicant had mistakenly referred to maintenance \u201cfor the rest of her life\u201d and, furthermore, had failed to show that she was entitled to maintenance and needed it. the court of cassation did not rule on the fact that the case file relating to the proceedings under canon law had not been examined by the court of appeal. 30.  from june 1992 the applicant\u2019s ex-husband ceased paying her maintenance. the applicant therefore began enforcement proceedings for payment of the maintenance by serving notice (precetto) on him to pay it. on 6 november 1994 her ex-husband lodged an objection with the viterbo court, which, in a judgment of 14 july 1999, upheld his objection and ruled that he no longer had to pay maintenance because the florence court of appeal had declared that the decision annulling the marriage was enforceable. the applicant did not appeal against that judgment because on 19 june 2000 she reached an agreement with her ex-husband (under the terms of that agreement she also withdrew another set of proceedings that she had instituted in the viterbo court claiming joint title to property).", "labels": ["6"]}
{"text": "7.  the applicant is a lithuanian national, born in 1974. 8.  from 5 october 1993 the applicant served a sentence of nine years\u2019 imprisonment for the theft, possession and sale of firearms. on an unspecified date in early april 1998 he was transferred from luki\u0161k\u0117s prison to pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison (pravieni\u0161ki\u0173 2-oji sustiprintojo re\u017eimo pataisos darb\u0173 kolonija). 9.  from the moment when the applicant arrived in pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison he was placed in the separate segregation unit of the prison (sunkiai aukl\u0117jam\u0173j\u0173 b\u016brys \u2013 \u201cthe sab\u201d), located in wing 5 of the prison (v lokalinis sektorius). on 30 june 1998 the applicant was released from the sab and detained under normal conditions in section 13 and later in section 21 (13 ir 21 brigados), located in wing 1 of the prison (i lokalinis sektorius). from 5 to 20 january 1999 the applicant was detained in solitary confinement (baudos izoliatorius). he was again placed in the sab on 20 january 1999. the applicant stayed in pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison until his release on 14 april 2000 following a presidential pardon. 10.  the present case concerns the conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention in pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison and his treatment there from april 1998 until april 2000. 11.  the evidence of the applicant was taken by the court delegates in vilnius on 25 may 2000 and then in pravieni\u0161k\u0117s on 26 may 2000. the applicant\u2019s statements may be summarised as follows.\n (a)  general conditions of detention\n(i)  the sab 12.  the unit consisted of a dormitory where twenty-two inmates were held, a small kitchen, a relaxation room and a shower cubicle. in the applicant\u2019s view, only six to eight persons could be held in the sab, and it was accordingly seriously overcrowded. only the dormitory had windows. there were no windows or ventilation in the kitchen and the relaxation room. a window was installed in the kitchen during renovations in 1999. 13.  the sab had a corridor leading to the small courtyard outside. the yard was closed off above with wire netting, which was covered with snow in the wintertime. as a result there was a lack of light in the courtyard during the winter. 14.  the toilets consisted of eight asian-type \u201csquat\u201d holes, which lacked partitions. inmates in the sab used the toilets one by one in order to respect each other\u2019s privacy. there were no windows, and a ventilation system was installed in the toilets only after renovations in late 1999. as a result the toilets smelled terribly. 15.  there was no access to the prison laundry for washing private clothes; it therefore had to be done by hand in bowls in the shower. drying such items in the small courtyard was complicated. in addition, no private bedding was allowed. every inmate received from the prison administration bed linen and towels, which were regularly washed in the prison laundry. 16.  the administrative officers visited the sab only during the distribution of meals and check-ups. the prison governor used to visit the unit from time to time. doctors went to the sab very rarely. the only way of communicating with the outside world was by telephone. on 11 june 1998 the applicant felt that he had a fever. his condition was so serious that he missed the regular check-ups at the sab and lay in bed. he asked the guards to send for a doctor. he also used the special telephone line connecting the sab to the prison medical service. however, no one answered, as it was lunchtime. the applicant did not telephone the medical service again. instead, he orally asked the sab guards for a doctor several times a day. the medical staff only arrived on 16 june 1998 and confirmed that he had caught a cold. he was told to stay in bed. 17.  no work, recreation or other meaningful activities were organised in the unit. the only reasonable activity permitted in the sab was playing chess. the applicant conceded that there were no restrictions on watching television, reading or listening to the radio.\n(ii)  the normal regime (wing 1) 18.  the applicant was detained in sections 13 and 21 located in wing 1 of the prison. each of the five wings of the prison was intended to hold 300 prisoners. the prison was seriously overcrowded. there were approximately 400 detainees in wing 1, which consisted of 12 sections \u2013 namely dormitories with adjacent toilet areas \u2013 where 20 to 30 prisoners were held. a total of 32 inmates were sleeping in section 13 at the time of the applicant\u2019s placement there. section 21 accommodated 24 inmates. in the applicant\u2019s view, a maximum of eight people could be held in section 13 and six people in section 21. the sections lacked air, especially at night, due to overcrowding. two-tier bunk beds were installed in the dormitories and the windows were almost completely hidden by these beds, thus obstructing the flow of fresh air from the outside. during the day, prisoners were allowed to circulate freely within the wing and its outside stroll yard. 19.  sanitary conditions were deplorable. toilets, sinks and shower facilities were infested with germs. there were various leaks and the water pipes were very old, rusty and covered with mould. the toilets in the sections consisted of several asian-type \u201csquat\u201d holes with no partitions between them. toilet paper was only provided sporadically. the applicant stated that it was very difficult to keep himself clean as he was only allowed to shower once a week on designated days. showering on an unspecified day was penalised. shower facilities only worked five days a week, and were always overcrowded. during the summer, hot water was only available at weekends. the applicant\u2019s bedding was washed in the prison laundry. private items such as clothes had to be washed by hand in a sink. 20.  food was served three times a day. only 2.17 litai (ltl) per prisoner per day were allocated by the authorities for the catering in pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison. the food was always cold, and there were no facilities to heat it. vegetables were only added to a course once a week. lunch was impossible to eat due to its awful taste at least three times a week. overall, food was not prepared in a sanitary manner. at times the applicant had found wood shavings, little stones and pieces of metal in his food. supplementary food could be provided by the prison canteen only when a special diet had been recommended by a doctor. as the prison canteen was not big enough for all prisoners, catering was organised in shifts. however, the number of inmates at each shift was always greater than the number of places in the canteen. a prisoner who arrived late would be left without food. there was a prison shop where detainees could obtain additional food. the applicant acknowledged that he regularly had a couple of hundred litai on his account in the prison shop. there was also a limited list of items that could be given by prisoners\u2019 relatives during personal visits. the applicant was permitted to receive additional food from his relatives. 21.  qualified doctors only visited the prison occasionally. it was therefore impossible to have permanent, professional medical assistance at the prison infirmary. the infirmary lacked medication, especially painkillers. all illnesses were treated with aspirin and paracetamol. the applicant stated that he had a heart disease. he admitted, however, that he had not undergone an appropriate cardiology test at the infirmary. the applicant also alleged that he had a knee problem due to his huge overweight. the prison administration had not performed a knee operation due to a lack of facilities. the applicant acknowledged, however, that the knee operation was not a matter of primary urgency. once out of prison, he had not sought a knee operation due to its high cost. the applicant further stated that he had had gastritis, but the prison doctors had refused to prescribe a better diet for him in the prison canteen. 22.  following an order of the minister of the interior, from august to november 1998, all prisoners were subjected to a \u201cstanding regime\u201d. no prisoner was permitted to lie in bed from the wake-up call at 6.30 a.m. to lock-in at 10.30 p.m., that is sixteen hours a day. exceptions to the order were permitted only upon recommendation by a doctor. the applicant complained that many detainees, himself in particular given his weight and heart problems, were unable to endure this regime. the prison doctors found, however, that the applicant was fit to comply with the order. upon various complaints by the applicant and other prisoners, the ombudsman recommended that the order be revoked. the applicant alleges that it was nevertheless maintained. 23.  there was no work provided within the prison, and the number of meaningful activities was very limited. weather permitting, it was possible to engage in open-air sports in the exercise yard; however, no such possibilities existed in winter. there were also few concerts or cinema shows. no retraining or educational programmes were organised in the prison. 24.  the applicant had initially complained about an interference with his right to receive visits from his relatives. during the interview with the court delegates he admitted, however, that he had been afforded sufficient opportunities to receive visits, particularly following an intervention by the ombudsman further to a complaint on his part.\n(iii)  the solitary confinement cell 25.  from 5 to 20 january 1999 the applicant was placed in a solitary confinement cell of approximately 6 sq. m where he was held with another person. there was an asian-type toilet, a sink for washing, and a table in the middle of the room.\n(b)  specific acts by the prison administration\n(i)  the body search of 7 may 1998 26.  on 7 may 1998 the applicant had a personal visit when he was given some additional food. afterwards he was stopped in the access zone for the usual security check to establish whether he had been given any illegal items. the chief guard, p., conducted the search, while two other officers looked on. p. told the applicant to take off his clothes. when the applicant was only in his underwear, a female prison officer, j., came into the room. p. then told the applicant to strip naked. the officer threatened him with a reprimand in case of non-compliance. the applicant submitted to the order, taking off his underwear, in the presence of ms j. she was watching the check with the rest of the officers and was smoking. the applicant\u2019s body, including his testicles, was examined by the male officers. the officers wore no gloves, touching the applicant\u2019s sexual organs and then the food given to him by his relatives, without washing their hands. the applicant was also ordered to do sit-ups to establish whether he had concealed anything in his anus. no unauthorised item was found on him. he alleged that the purpose of the check had been to ridicule him in front of the woman.\n(ii)  alleged victimisation of the applicant and the absence of review 27.  according to the applicant, the lower-ranking prison staff were very poorly qualified, had an inferiority complex, and showed their authority in a degrading manner. the administration tolerated the constant consumption of alcohol by the prison staff during working hours. many prisoners were allegedly employed as secret informers by the administration, in return for promises of parole or conditional release. the actions of the prison staff concerning the applicant were provocative. the applicant received daily abuse because of his firm opposition to and the criticism of the general policies of the penitentiary system in lithuania, as well as his specific criticism of the conditions of detention at the prison. he gave the following examples of his alleged victimisation. 28.  the applicant\u2019s placement in the sab in april 1998 had been arbitrary, as he had had no disciplinary record before that date. following his release from the sab on 30 june 1998, he was detained under the normal regime and even afforded better conditions of detention. on 20 august 1998 some prisoners established an association for their mutual assistance and support called aim. the applicant was elected president of that association. on 24 august 1998 the administration imposed on the applicant a disciplinary penalty, depriving him of the better detention conditions. the official ground for that penalty, imposed on the basis of information given to the administration by a secret informer, was the fact that the applicant had beaten another prisoner. the applicant denied the beating, stating that he had been present at the incident without intervening. the applicant\u2019s complaints to the prison department and the ombudsman about the unlawfulness of the penalty were rejected as unsubstantiated. 29.  on 10 october 1998 the applicant\u2019s right to buy food at the prison shop was suspended for one month, and on 13 october 1998 he received a disciplinary warning for threatening other prisoners with force. the administration rejected his complaints against these penalties. his application against a staff member, officer kmieliauskas, who had allegedly initiated these penalties, was not examined. 30.  on 15 october 1998 the applicant was penalised for leaving the territory of wing 1. he was ordered to wash the windows of section 21. the execution of this penalty was to be controlled by officer kmieliauskas. the applicant initially refused to wash the windows in the presence of the said member of staff and other prisoners, as this allegedly meant the manifest abuse of his right to complain about that member of staff. the applicant later washed the windows while not being observed. officer kmieliauskas refused to accept that the work had been done. 31.  on 16 october 1998, as the prison governor was absent, officer kmieliauskas ordered the applicant\u2019s solitary confinement. he was instantly conveyed to the solitary confinement cell in handcuffs. within an hour, the prison governor returned to the prison. after hearing the applicant and certain prison officers, the prison governor decided that the applicant had not been in breach of duty on 15 october 1998 and the applicant was immediately released from solitary confinement. 32.  in his written submissions to the court, the applicant stated that on 23 october 1998 he had been warned for still being asleep at 6.40 a.m., this being ten minutes after the regulation wake-up call. during the meeting with the court delegates he insisted that the officers had arrived and found him in his bed at 6.30 a.m. on 28 october 1998 he received a further disciplinary warning for queuing beyond the privacy line while waiting to call his relatives on the telephone. 33.  in december 1998 \u201cconfidential sources\u201d informed the applicant that one member of staff, b., was involved in criminal activities relating to the falsification of documents. on 28 december 1998 the applicant lodged a specific complaint against b. on behalf of aim. the complaint was given to the administration in order to be transmitted to the ombudsman. on 29 december 1998 a high-ranking member of the prison administration allegedly requested the applicant not to send the complaint, promising that b. would be dismissed, and that the applicant would be afforded better detention conditions. the applicant refused to do so and insisted on the onward transmission of the complaint. according to the applicant, b. was forced to leave the prison service as a result of the ombudsman\u2019s investigation. in december 1998 the applicant also filed with the ombudsman a complaint against another staff member, p., for allegedly abusing his authority. the applicant claimed, in particular, that p. had deliberately provoked conflicts with the applicant and other prisoners. this complaint was dismissed as unsubstantiated. 34.  on 21 december 1998 the applicant met the prison governor, who granted him permission to visit detainees in other wings to greet them for christmas on behalf of aim. according to the applicant\u2019s written submissions to the court the permission was oral, but he also stated during the meeting with the court delegates that the permission had been posted in writing on the special information board. the permission was valid from 24 to 27 december 1998. on 24 december 1998 the applicant tried to go from wing 1 to wing 3. at a special check-point between these wings, the applicant was stopped by the guards and told that he did not have permission to enter wing 3. 35.  on 29 december 1998, as a disciplinary sanction for \u201ctrespassing\u201d on 24 december, the applicant was ordered to clean up the area around his bed in section 21. as the interim prison rules did not require that cleaning be done in the presence of a member of staff, he performed the work unseen. the staff member, officer kmieliauskas, who was to supervise the work, did not accept that the job had been done. 36.  as a result, on 5 january 1999 the applicant was punished with fifteen days\u2019 solitary confinement. he immediately announced a hunger strike as he considered the sanction arbitrary. on 6 january 1999 the applicant wrote complaints to various state authorities and the media. on 8 january 1999 the applicant\u2019s sister called the prison governor, who allegedly lied to her that the applicant was not on a hunger strike. on 9 january 1999 the biggest lithuanian daily, lietuvos rytas, wrote an article on page 2, stating that the applicant was on a hunger strike. on the sixth day of the hunger strike, on 11 january 1999, a prosecutor arrived and advised the applicant to seek a compromise with the administration. on 13 january 1999 the applicant discontinued the hunger strike. on 15 january 1999 the prison governor gave an interview to a newspaper, akistata, which was printed with the title \u201cstirring up trouble without reason\u201d. in the interview the prison governor said that the applicant was \u201cdoing nothing [to conform to the prison regime] but lodging various complaints\u201d. according to the applicant, the prison governor thereby expressed his biased attitude towards him. 37.  on 21 january 1999 two disciplinary sanctions were imposed on the applicant for the unlawful hunger strike. his access to the prison shop and the right to be given additional food during personal visits were suspended. he was also transferred to the sab. 38.  the applicant considered that these penalties, taken as a whole, revealed the ineffectiveness of any internal efforts to review allegations of ill-treatment. his complaints about the disciplinary penalties against him were rejected by the ombudsman with sole reference to the statements of the prison administration, without due regard to the actual circumstances. according to the applicant, his treatment in the prison was degrading because he had no access to an independent and impartial authority to complain about his conditions of detention. 39.  there was no information about any effective review of the general treatment of prisoners or the specific treatment of the applicant because the interim prison rules (pataisos darb\u0173 \u012fstaig\u0173 laikinosios taisykl\u0117s) had not been published. the rules defined the legal basis for the prison regime and the administration\u2019s actions. the absence of publicity of such an important legal document gave the administration the right to act arbitrarily. this document was lacking both at the prison department and in prisons. in the applicant\u2019s view, every section of the prison should have had a copy of the rules. however, only one copy of the rules was in his prison.\n(iii)the control of correspondence with the convention organs 40.  the applicant stated that the first letter addressed to him from the european commission of human rights, dated 18 june 1998, was shown to him when it had already been opened. he was only allowed to write down its contents, and had to give it back to the administration. subsequent letters from the convention organs were opened by the administration and given to the applicant some three days after their arrival at the prison. 41.  on 7 december 1998 the prison governor wrote a letter to the court, stating, inter alia:\n\u201con 2 december 1998 the prison administration received a letter by [the applicant] addressed to [the court]. having acquainted myself with the contents of the letter ... i would like to set out certain considerations as to the facts alleged [therein] ...\nit is true that pursuant to the order of 14 august 1998 of the minister of the interior ... it is prohibited for convicted persons to lie in bed save during the sleeping hours as specified in the schedule, if there is no special permission to do so from the administration ..., [but] it is not true that all convicted persons have been prevented from lying in bed during the day, as j. vala\u0161inas says in the letter ... because elderly, handicapped [prisoners] have been afforded [that] opportunity ...\n[the applicant] alleges that some wings in the prison accommodate more than 400 convicted persons in breach of rule 2 \u00a7 11 of the prison rules requiring that \u2018no more than 300 persons should be held in a wing\u2019. [however,] there is no practical possibility to implement the above rule in view of the rapid increase in the number of convicted persons (the limit is 1,830 [detainees], [but] on 3 december 1998 there were 2,109).\nas regards the education of convicted persons ..., from 1 january 1999 the administration of the kaunas county is prepared to set up an education point for adults in the prison ...\non 20 august 1998 [the applicant] founded an association of mutual assistance and support, \u2018aim\u2019 ... we think that the establishment of this association is to be welcomed ... however, in practice, from the moment when it was set up, this association and its president, j. vala\u0161inas, only defended the interests ... of the \u2018authorities\u2019 of the underworld ...\u201d 42.  in a letter to the court dated 16 december 1998, the applicant\u2019s sister complained that the applicant had told her by telephone on 15 december 1998 that he had been prohibited from pursuing correspondence with the court, and that his letters to the court dated 30 november and 3 december 1998 had not been sent by the prison administration. 43.  on 18 december 1998 the administration sent to the registry the applicant\u2019s letters of 30 november, 3 december and 15 december 1998. they also included a transcript of the administration\u2019s meeting of 15 december 1998 in which the question of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the court was discussed. the acting governor of the prison said in the transcript that he\n\u201cexplained to [the applicant] that he has to apply first to certain authorities of the republic of lithuania, that is: the prisons department, the ministry of the interior, the ministry of justice, the ombudsman, the office of the prosecutor general and other institutions. [the applicant] is familiar with this procedure ... but he categorically required that his letter to [the court] be sent ... [the applicant] asked me the question whether i had a right to have access to the contents of [his] letter ... i explained that i had such a right under rule 7 \u00a7 1 (7) of the interim prison rules [stating that] \u2018the letters of convicted persons (except those to a prosecutor) that are sent or received are subject to censorship\u2019. given the categorical request by [the applicant], [his] complaint shall be sent to the addressee\u201d. 44.  on 1 march 1999 the registry received one more letter from the applicant, sent on 15 february 1999. according to him, this letter was not sent through the prison administration. he enclosed therewith an original of the registry\u2019s letter of 14 january 1999 as evidence that the correspondence with the court had been censored: on the registry\u2019s letter was a prison stamp with the date of receipt, 1 february 1999, a handwritten remark of the same date by the prison governor ordering that the applicant be acquainted with the letter, and the applicant\u2019s written confirmation that he had had such access on 3 february 1999. 45.  during the meeting with the court delegates, the applicant also stated that in december 1998 he had handed to the prison administration a further letter to the court dated 16 december 1998. no such letter reached the court. 46.  the witness was the prison governor at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention there.\n(a)  general conditions of detention\n(i)  the sab 47.  the witness admitted that there had been no partitions between the squat holes in the toilets until 1999. in that year renovations were carried out, during which each toilet hole was separated by cement partitions covered with ceramic tiles.\n \n(ii)  the normal regime (wing 1) 48.  at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention under the normal conditions in wing 1, each prisoner was allocated 2.7 sq. m in the dormitory in section 13, and 3.2 sq. m in the dormitory in section 21. the prison code (pataisos darb\u0173 kodeksas) required a minimum space of 2 sq. m in sleeping areas, while a special ministry of health sanitary norm of 1999 required at least 3 sq. m. the witness considered that the prison had not been seriously overcrowded at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention, at least within the meaning of the domestic requirements valid until 1999. the situation improved following an amnesty act in 2000; while the total occupancy of the prison was 2,303 detainees in 1999, only 1,782 prisoners were detained in may 2000, the lowest level in five years. 49.  prisoners were provided with bed linen, which was washed and dried in the prison laundry free of charge once every two weeks. once a week inmates had access to the shower. sinks in the shower facilities could also be used to wash personal items. each prisoner was provided free of charge with 200 g of soap every month, and was able to buy more in the shop. 50.  inmates could buy various products, including food and items of personal hygiene, in the prison shop three times a month. prices in the shop were not excessive, and were regularly reviewed by the administration in the light of regional price levels. while no cash was used in the prison shop, every inmate had an account to which resources from his family, his salary at the prison, or a financial benefit in the case of an orphan, were transferred. these accounts were debited upon a purchase at the shop. 51.  the witness admitted that the canteen, which could normally accommodate about 500 prisoners at once, had been overcrowded at times. he denied, however, that any prisoner had missed a meal due to overcrowding. five shifts were organised in the canteen to enable every prisoner to have three meals a day. the witness had never received a complaint from any prisoner that he had been deprived of a meal because of an overcrowded canteen. the witness had not heard of any complaint about the quality of the food. he said that the prison medical service checked the quality of the food every day and that the sanitary norms in the canteen were being met. 52.  the witness had not received any complaint from the applicant about a lack of medical assistance in the prison. the witness also said that the prison doctor and the health authorities had confirmed that a knee operation had not been necessary during the applicant\u2019s detention. the witness had never received a complaint from the applicant that he had been supplied with a food item incompatible with the sanitary norms. nor had the applicant complained that he had lacked a special diet in the prison or needed supplementary food to be provided free of charge. 53.  previously, there were no partitions between the squat holes in the toilets; they were installed during the 1999 renovations. currently all toilets were equipped with partitions. the witness said that a special government decree of 1995 required that all inmates be given toilet paper. however, the prison administration had budgetary difficulties in complying with this decree. toilet paper had not been distributed during recent months. the prison lacked money even for the postal service. the witness considered that the lack of free toilet paper was not an essential problem in the prison, as he had heard no complaint in this connection from any prisoner. according to the witness, it had to be noted that toilet paper was always available in the prison shop at about ltl 0.50 to 0.60 per roll. in addition, toilet paper could be given by relatives. at worst, other kinds of paper could be used, such as newspapers, which were supplied to prisoners free of charge. the witness drew a parallel between toilet paper and other items of personal hygiene, such as toothpaste and toothbrushes. while such items were not distributed free of charge, prisoners could obtain them from their relatives or the prison shop. 54.  the prison had a wood-processing factory, but only a small proportion of prisoners worked there due to the lack of commercial orders. however, a recent government contract would permit an increase in production and create more employment for detainees. a total of 115 prisoners also worked at the service department of the prison, including the laundry and the canteen. the applicant did not work during the time of his detention.\n(b)  specific acts of the administration\n(i)  the body search of 7 may 1998 55.  after a personal visit, a prisoner and any items he has received from his visitor must be checked in accordance with the interim prison rules. such a check could include stripping the prisoner naked. the interim prison rules provide that only a person of the same sex may conduct a strip-search. 56.  the witness said that he was not present at the time of the alleged event. he was informed about it by the applicant. the witness acknowledged that the female officer j. worked at the prison and supervised personal visits. her functions included accompanying prisoners to and from the visitors\u2019 area and handing the prisoner over to the male officers conducting the search. the court was unable to interview ms j. as she was not in the prison on the day of the delegation\u2019s visit. 57.  the three male officers who conducted the body search were interviewed by the witness immediately following the applicant\u2019s complaint in may 1998. they denied that a woman had been present. no record of the applicant\u2019s complaint or of any investigation of the incident was made. 58.  the witness said that he did not know whether ms j. took part in the search. if the applicant was stripped naked in the presence of a woman, it was a violation of the interim prison rules. however, given ms j.\u2019s functions, the witness conceded that both theoretically and practically she could have attended the search.\n(ii)  alleged victimisation of the applicant and the absence of review 59.  the witness described the procedure for disciplinary offences established under the interim prison rules. according to this system, pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison had a disciplinary commission consisting of the prison governor, his deputies and the heads of sections. the commission was in charge of examining all alleged violations of prison discipline. when a particular incident occurred or specific information about such an incident reached the administration, a senior staff member such as a head of section wrote a report on the facts and stated his opinion as to whether those facts disclosed a breach by a detainee of the provisions of the interim prison rules. the report was normally shown to the detainee, who had the right to submit observations. the detainee was informed about the contents of the report if it could not be presented to him, for example, where there were statements by anonymous witnesses concerning the incident. however, even in such exceptional cases, the prisoner had the right to know about such accusations without having access to the witnesses\u2019 names.\nthe report and the detainee\u2019s observations were sent to the disciplinary commission, which decided whether or not to impose a disciplinary penalty. it was an absolute requirement that the prisoner appeared in person before the commission prior to its reaching its decision. witnesses who were detainees were not normally heard in person at the hearing, their evidence being included in the report in written form. however, any officer involved in the incident had to be heard in person by the commission, together with the alleged perpetrator. 60.  it was possible to appeal against the commission\u2019s decision. where a report on the incident had been filed by a staff member no higher in rank than a deputy governor, the prison governor could quash the penalty. where the report had been filed by the governor himself, the detainee could appeal to the director of the prison department. from there an appeal lay to the minister of the interior or the ombudsman. although the ombudsman could not revoke the penalty, he could recommend that the prison authorities do so. in most cases the ombudsman\u2019s recommendations were followed. in general, prisoners were not prohibited from complaining to any authority concerning any aspect of their detention. however, the internal hierarchical procedure was the principal remedy for prisoners. 61.  the procedure for complaints against staff members was similar to that for disciplinary offences. the witness was not aware of any specific complaint by the applicant against a staff member. he said however that, if the applicant had lodged any such complaint, it had been sent to the competent authority. 62.  all detainees were familiar with the interim prison rules, which established this procedure and set out other provisions pertaining to the regime in all lithuanian prisons. a copy of the rules and of the prison code was in the prison library. every detainee had unlimited access to those documents. in addition, upon the arrival of a new prisoner, a head of section must inform him of the rules, which had to be confirmed by the detainee\u2019s signature. 63.  the witness hardly knew the applicant personally until august 1998. the applicant had had no disciplinary record during the period of his placement in the prison before that. the witness had participated in the foundation meeting of the aim association in august 1998. he considered that the purposes of the association as stated in its statute, namely mutual assistance and support to defend prisoners\u2019 rights and better conditions of detention, were to be welcomed. there had been no interference by the administration with the functioning of the association. however, according to the witness, after becoming the leader of aim, the applicant forgot that he himself was a prisoner and that he had not only rights but also obligations. he ignored lawful orders from staff and on various occasions seriously breached prison discipline. 64.  the witness confirmed that the applicant had received nine disciplinary punishments during his time at the prison, namely on 24 august, 10, 13, 15, 23 and 28 october, 29 december 1998, and 5 and 21 january 1999. as to the nature of these punishments, the witness stated that eight of them had been minor. the deprivation of better detention conditions on 24 august 1998 involved the temporary removal of the applicant\u2019s entitlement to certain socio-economic benefits, such as the right to receive additional personal visits, to make purchases in the prison shop, or to receive parcels from relatives. the disciplinary warnings of 13, 23 and 28 october 1998 meant essentially remarks in the applicant\u2019s prison file. the chores (bud\u0117jimas be eil\u0117s) imposed on 15 october and 29 december 1998 were insignificant cleaning jobs. these penalties were minor, as the applicant\u2019s breaches of discipline had not been serious.\nonly the penalty of 5 january 1999, namely the applicant\u2019s solitary confinement, was to be considered serious, in the opinion of the witness. it was imposed for non-compliance with the legitimate order of a prison officer, namely the failure of the applicant on 29 december 1998 to wash the area around his bed. in any event, none of those penalties humiliated the applicant, in the view of the witness, but amounted to the normal enforcement of prison discipline. 65.  the witness asserted that good reasons had been given for each of the punishments. in every case the prison management carefully assessed the facts about alleged disciplinary breaches by the applicant and properly weighed the evidence before them. the validity of the conclusions of the prison management was confirmed by the ombudsman. the witness mentioned as an example the events of 16 october 1998, when it was not clear whether or not the applicant had personally performed the chore imposed on 15 october 1998. regardless of the statements of officer kmieliauskas alleging that the applicant had not performed the task himself, the witness decided that the applicant should have the benefit of the doubt, and that there had been no breach of discipline. however, in another case, concerning the chore imposed on 29 december 1998, the overwhelming evidence suggested that the applicant had indeed breached discipline by ordering another detainee to perform his task. as a result the applicant was punished with solitary confinement. 66.  the witness admitted that he had said that the applicant \u201cwas doing nothing but lodging complaints\u201d in an interview published on 19 january 1999 in akistata, a special newspaper on matters of crime, law and order. the witness did not consider that he had in any way humiliated the applicant by that statement. he said that he had no personal prejudice towards the applicant because of his activism amongst prisoners, his presidency of aim, his complaint to the convention organs, or any other reason. the sole basis for the measures restricting the applicant\u2019s rights was his failure to comply with prison discipline, which was applied equally to all. 67.  the witness said that the reasonable nature of the applicant\u2019s treatment in the prison was reflected by the fact that he had expunged the applicant\u2019s disciplinary record in 1999. thereafter they had found a common ground and cooperated in organising various cultural events in the prison. furthermore, in view of the applicant\u2019s improved behaviour, the witness intervened on the applicant\u2019s behalf to obtain a presidential pardon, which was eventually granted. their cooperation continued after the applicant\u2019s release, particularly regarding the organisation of cultural activities in the prison.\n(iii)  the control of correspondence with the convention organs 68.  the witness acknowledged that until june 1999 the prison administration had checked the applicant\u2019s letters to the convention organs in accordance with the prison code and the interim prison rules. the witness stated that he had never prevented the applicant from complaining to the court. his remarks about the exhaustion of domestic remedies were made to explain to the applicant the relevant procedural requirements, but not to hinder his right to pursue his convention application. all letters to the court handed in by the applicant to the prison administration were sent, and all letters from the convention organs were received by the applicant. 69.  the witness was a staff member and a head of section. 70.  the witness stated that the applicant belonged to the so-called \u00e9lite of prisoners, and other inmates would normally perform jobs for him. this is why he did not think that the applicant had personally performed the chore imposed on 29 december 1998. the officer did not consider that the obligation to clean the area around his bed whilst supervised by the witness was degrading for the applicant. while the applicant had asked the witness in advance for permission to perform the task unsupervised, the applicant had not explained why he did not want to be observed or whether he considered the order degrading. the applicant\u2019s request had clearly been an attempt to get others to do the job for him. therefore the witness did not give his permission. the applicant\u2019s subsequent refusal to perform the job in the presence of the witness amounted to a breach of duty. 71.  on 26 may 2000 the delegates visited the prison. the prison held 1,782 people, a substantial reduction from the 2,303 prisoners held in 1999. 72.  the delegates visited the sab where twenty people were detained, whereas twenty-two had been detained when the applicant was there. the beds had metal frames and springs, standing on four legs about 30 cm high. the beds were side by side in a dormitory of 92.2 sq. m. there were televisions, a video-player, radios, personal effects and adequate bedding. each prisoner was allocated approximately 5 sq. m of space in the dormitory. there did not seem to be a lack of space, light or air. 73.  the delegates visited a separate sanitation area in a corridor between the dormitory and the leisure room. the sanitation area consisted of toilets and a shower. prisoners could use the shower at any time between wake-up at 6.30 a.m. and lock-in at 10.30 p.m. the area had been tiled and partial partitions installed between the asian-type toilets since the applicant\u2019s detention there. the partitions were waist high, half walls, with no doors in front of them. in the applicant\u2019s time there had just been the squat holes. there was no toilet paper in sight. the sanitation area was somewhat muddy but not unduly smelly. the delegates learnt that people were paid to do the cleaning, and that prisoners were asked to clean only as a disciplinary punishment. 74.  food was brought from the main prison into a small kitchen three times a day. there was a courtyard, approximately the same size as the dormitory, with grass, plants, outdoor tables and benches and some weight-lifting equipment. there was no limitation on prisoners\u2019 access to the courtyard between 6.30 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. prisoners did not wear a uniform. most of them were in light tracksuits and t-shirts. detainees were able to wash their own personal laundry in the sanitation area, and the delegates saw laundry being dried on clotheslines outside in the courtyard. inmates could come and go as they liked within the whole sab area, where there were also separate leisure and billiard rooms. only the leisure room had no windows, but there was no lack of air. there were soft armchairs, a chessboard and an audio-system in the leisure room. big heating radiators were seen in all the accommodation areas. 75.  people could call the prison medical service directly from the sab on a special telephone line. a doctor visited the sab almost on a daily basis, and a sick person would be brought to the infirmary. 76.  the applicant confirmed that the conditions of his detention in the sab had been essentially the same, except that the accommodation area had since been freshly painted and better furnished, partitions had been installed in the toilets, and a kitchen window had been created. 77.  the delegates then moved to the area of the normal regime in wing 1, namely an apartment block with 775.2 sq. m of living space and an adjacent large strolling yard. there were twelve sections in the wing. sections consisted of dormitories with adjacent toilet areas. at the time of the visit, 372 detainees were held in wing 1, whereas there had been 400 inmates when the applicant was there. 78.  section 13 had a dormitory of 86.5 sq. m holding 32 beds; some were double bunk beds. the beds had metal frames and springs, standing on four legs about 30 cm high. each prisoner had approximately 2.7 sq. m in the dormitory. the room had windows and did not lack light or air. several prisoners were in the dormitory during the daytime as inmates were entitled to circulate freely throughout the whole building and yard from 6.30 a.m. until 10.30 p.m. there were four stools in the room. the delegates were told by a staff member that detainees were allowed to sit or lie on the beds during the day. 79.  section 21 had a dormitory of 55.3 sq. m holding 24 beds placed side by side. each prisoner was allocated approximately 3.2 sq. m of space in the dormitory. there were two large windows but the applicant nevertheless complained about the lack of ventilation. the windows were open during the delegates\u2019 visit, but the applicant said they remained shut in winter or if someone was ill. 80.  the toilets in both sections were located in separate areas closed off from the dormitories. there were partitioned asian-type holes, which did not seem to be in a bad or dirty condition. there was no particular smell or lack of air in the toilets. the applicant said that the walls had been painted since his time and partitions had been installed. 81.  the general shower room allowed thirty prisoners to shower at the same time; this was not a renovated area. the installations were rusty and there was mould on the walls, but hot water was available and the area was generally functioning adequately. the room next to the showers had deep basins for prisoners to wash their own clothes. prisoners were allowed access to the showers once a week. 82.  the canteen consisted of two big rooms with seating arrangements for about 500 people. the food was prepared in large ovens and saucepans where huge quantities of soup (sometimes with meat), vegetables and porridge were cooked. the quantity per prisoner was controlled by the medical service, as was the level of hygiene. the general area seemed spotless apart from some dampness on the floor. food was dished out in metal bowls for ten people and served through two hatches in the canteen. 83.  the infirmary had several consultation rooms, a dentist\u2019s chair and other equipment being in one of them. all the equipment seemed old-fashioned but functional. since february 1999 there had been a doctor on duty twenty-four hours a day. the doctor on duty said that if someone had a fever he would get help from the infirmary. 84.  the delegates next visited the solitary confinement cell in a separate building, where the applicant was detained from 5 to 20 january 1999. this consisted of a narrow room in which two people could be detained. during the day the beds are locked up against the wall like a couchette on a train. the cell had low benches and a cupboard. it also had a separate closed toilet and washbasin. the applicant said that during his placement there the walls had not been painted, there had been no cupboard, and the bedding was taken out of the cell in the daytime. 85.  on 10 september 1998 the ombudsman rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s complaint against the disciplinary penalty of 24 august 1998 depriving him of better conditions of detention. the ombudsman noted that the applicant solely contested the facts of the incident leading to the penalty, arguing that he had not beaten up another prisoner. on the basis of written observations by the prison management, the statement of an anonymous witness and the applicant\u2019s explanations, the ombudsman established that the applicant had participated in the beating and that the administration had duly imposed the penalty. 86.  on 19 january 1999, on the basis of written observations by the prison administration and the applicant, the ombudsman rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s complaints against the penalties of 10 and 13 october 1998. the ombudsman noted that the applicant solely contested the facts as established by the prison administration and had provided no plausible evidence to cast doubt on the validity of the conclusion that he had threatened other prisoners with force. 87.  on 19 january 1999 the ombudsman also dismissed as unfounded the applicant\u2019s complaint about the penalty of 15 october 1998. on the basis of written observations by the prison administration and the applicant, the ombudsman found that the applicant had trespassed into the territory of wing 3 without permission. according to the interim prison rules, a detainee must obtain the permission of the prison governor to visit other wings. such a decision was valid only if it was published on the special information board. the applicant had not contested that he had had no permission to leave wing 1 on that day or that he had not known of the relevant internal requirements prohibiting trespass. he was therefore justifiably ordered to perform a chore on that day. 88.  on the same date the ombudsman rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s complaints against the disciplinary warnings of 23 and 28 october 1998. the ombudsman noted that the applicant solely contested the facts as established by the prison administration and had provided no plausible evidence to cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions that he had been sleeping after the regulatory wake-up call, or that he had been queuing beyond the privacy line. 89.  on 19 january 1999 the ombudsman also dismissed complaints by the applicant and another two prisoners, b. and p., against the penalties of 29 december 1998, imposing chores. by reference to written observations by the prison administration and the detainees\u2019 comments, the ombudsman established that the applicant, together with b. and p., all of whom were wing 1 inmates, were stopped by guards when trespassing into the territory of wing 3. the detainees claimed that they had oral permission from both the prison governor and other guards to go to wing 3, and that the penalties had thus been arbitrary. the ombudsman found that no valid permission had been given to these men, and that the penalties of 29 december 1998 had therefore been justified. 90.  on 21 january 1999 the ombudsman rejected complaints by the applicant and b. against the disciplinary penalties of 5 january 1999 ordering their solitary confinement for non-compliance with the duties imposed on 29 december 1998. by reference to written observations by the prison administration and the detainees\u2019 comments, as well as the material collected on the spot by a representative of the ombudsman\u2019s office in january 1999, the ombudsman established that the applicant and b. had been ordered to clean the areas around their own beds by officer kmieliauskas, in execution of the duties imposed on 29 december 1998. the ombudsman held that the applicant and b., owing to their authority over other prisoners, could indeed have ordered other prisoners to clean up for them, thereby avoiding executing personally the penalties of 29 december 1998. according to the ombudsman, it was therefore reasonable for officer kmieliauskas to want to supervise the task himself. such supervision could not amount to an unjustified interference with their honour. the ombudsman established that the detainees had refused to perform the job under the supervision of officer kmieliauskas and another staff member at around 10.50 a.m. on 29 december 1998. some time later they informed officer kmieliauskas that they had nonetheless performed the task whilst alone. the ombudsman held that both the refusal of the detainees to perform their duties, and their subsequent statements that they had performed the jobs in the absence of staff, testified to their non-compliance with the penalty of 29 december 1998. the ombudsman concluded that the penalties of 5 january 1999 had therefore been justified. 91.  on 21 january 1999 the ombudsman examined the applicant\u2019s complaints against two members of staff, on the basis of an on-the-spot investigation conducted by a representative of the ombudsman\u2019s office in january 1999. in his complaints the applicant alleged that one member of staff, b., did not know the lithuanian language, did not have lithuanian citizenship, and could not work at the prison. he also alleged that a staff member, p., had provoked conflicts between the applicant and other prisoners. the ombudsman held that there were no grounds to examine the complaint in so far as it concerned b., who had meanwhile left the prison. the ombudsman established no wrongdoing or intent to provoke conflicts on the part of p.; in this regard the ombudsman held that the applicant\u2019s complaints had been of a general nature, and that, during the meeting with the representative of the ombudsman\u2019s office, the applicant had been unable to specify a single incident when p. had breached his rights.", "labels": ["3", "8"]}
{"text": "7.  on 11 february 1980, the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility in respect of the death of his 62\u2011year-old landlady whom he had battered with an axe. he was sentenced to life imprisonment. the court acted on medical evidence that the applicant had a gross personality disorder to such a degree that he was amoral. the consultant psychiatrist said in his report at the trial that:\n\u201c... although [the applicant\u2019s] instability might get less over the years as he matured, should he be sent to prison, his eventual release should be approached with great caution.\u201d 8.  the applicant was initially sent to a category a prison due to concerns about his dangerousness and risk of escape. he was involved in work to address his offending and other problems. he successfully completed an anger management and skills courts in the hull special unit in or about 1989 and his conduct was noted as significantly improving from that point. in 1993, he was transferred to a category b prison. 9.  the applicant\u2019s tariff period of 15 years expired on 25 june 1994 (this was the minimum period fixed by the secretary of state concerning the requirements of retribution and deterrence). the parole board in that month agreed to the transfer of the applicant from a category b to category c prison. the secretary of state deferred a decision until after the discretionary lifer panel (dlp) of the parole board had conducted a hearing on the matter under the new provisions of the criminal justice act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 act\u201d). 10.  on 13 december 1994, after a hearing held pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 act, the dlp decided it would not be safe to release the applicant but recommended transfer to category d (open prison), or category c with a review after 12 months instead of the usual two year period. on 15 march 1995, the secretary of state decided to transfer the applicant to category c with a review after 12 months. 11.  in november 1995, the applicant failed to obtain leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of the dlp and the decision of the secretary of state. in april 1996, the court of appeal refused leave to apply for judicial review. 12.  following a positive drugs test, the applicant agreed to follow and successfully completed in july 1996 a drugs awareness course. 13.  on 9 october 1996, the applicant\u2019s case came before another dlp. reports noted that he had made considerable progress over the preceding six years but would need phased re-introduction into society. a psychiatric report dated 24 june 1996 stated that the applicant had much greater control over his behaviour, that personal and maturational developments had taken place and that he was not the same person that he was when he entered prison. it was concluded that the applicant, who had shown a reclusiveness and narrowness of interests, needed however to test and increase his social interaction in order to be able to cope with living outside prison. a psychiatric report issued about the same time stated that the applicant\u2019s personality, described as psychopathic, had shown some capacity for change and that, although he was not considered a serious risk to the public, any release on licence would have to be carefully planned, as problems were likely to arise following a long period of institutionalisation and a lack of family support. the dlp did not recommend release but transfer to a category d prison. in paragraph 5 of the decision letter the dlp said:\n\u201cthe panel were satisfied that what was advanced at the hearing as \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019, namely a good release plan, the fact that [the applicant is] four years beyond tariff, the fact that [the applicant has] completed a pre-release course in category c, the fact that [the applicant had] previously been recommended for category d status and the prospect of employment, did not amount to exceptional circumstances and that [the applicant\u2019s] release without progress through open conditions posed an unacceptable risk.\u201d 14.  on 20 november 1996, the secretary of state rejected the recommendation of transfer to an open prison, but directed an early review of the applicant\u2019s case, namely after 18 months had expired from 9 october 1996. the secretary of state was not persuaded that the applicant\u2019s behavioural problems had been satisfactorily addressed while in closed conditions, nor that the benefits of open conditions were sufficiently worthwhile at that stage when balanced against the scale of the outstanding offence, related work needed in the applicant\u2019s case and his potential risk to the public. 15.  the applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of both decisions, alleging inter alia that the dlp had wrongly applied an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d test. leave was refused on 11 april 1997. 16.  on 21 october 1997, the applicant re-applied for leave for judicial review. mr justice potts refused leave against the dlp\u2019s recommendation. he found that the dlp had correctly applied the statutory test concerning a risk to the public. he granted leave to apply in respect of the decision of the secretary of state. mr justice potts stated:\n\u201c... a prisoner who has spent a long period in custody should be tested in open conditions before being released into the community: satisfactory completion of such testing is an indication that a prisoner is able to cope with the stresses of life outside prison and is therefore a cogent factor to take into account against all the other available material in deciding whether or not a prisoner can safely be released. such an approach is undoubtedly sensible \u2026\ni think it is arguable that the secretary of state\u2019s decision not to recategorise this applicant as a category d prisoner was irrational and one that no reasonable home secretary could reasonably have reached.\u201d 17.  in the light of this grant of leave, at the end of the hearing, the secretary of state indicated that he would reconsider his decision of 20 november 1997. 18.  on 13 march 1998, the secretary of state informed the applicant that he had reconsidered the case but decided not to change his conclusion that the applicant should not be transferred to open conditions. 19.  on 15 july 1998, the dlp again considered the applicant\u2019s case. reports continued to note his progress, including the expression of genuine remorse for his offending. it was considered in a case officer report dated 31 october 1997 that he had taken advantage of treatment programmes and that all offending work had been completed. he had a \u201csettled and fulfilling release plan\u201d which involved him continuing the legal studies that he had commenced in prison and receiving support from a circle of friends that he had built up through contacts outside prison. conversely, a psychiatric report dated 18 december 1997 considered inter alia that the applicant might benefit from further work on developing methods of dealing with interpersonal difficulties and increasing relationship skills. 20.  by letter dated 16 july 1998, the dlp declined to recommend release but did recommend transfer to a category d (open) prison.\n\u201c3.  in reaching the decision that you are not yet suitable for release, the panel took into account the nature of the index offence, your violent disruptive early prison career (while recognising also the absence of any violence since 1989), the fact that you are still seen as having a psychopathic personality \u2026 and the remaining areas of concern identified by [mrs b, a higher psychologist]\u2026 these areas of concern are egocentricity, a disregard for the points of view of other people and a limited ability to solve interpersonal frustrations and problems. the panel also considered that the sexual ambivalence referred to by [dr g] merited further investigation, particularly in light of evidence that emerged at the panel hearing that you had been sexually abused in your youth. the panel also accepted [mrs b\u2019s] evidence that a personality assessment was necessary to identify the manner in which the outstanding offence-related work should be carried out; and that the reasons underlying the index offence still require further investigation. in all these circumstances, the panel considered that you still presented too great a risk to the public to justify your release. 4.  moreover, you have been in custody for 19 years and although your release plan is being developed, it is not complete. at present you would have no fixed accommodation. based on these factors and the impression the panel formed of you at the hearing, the panel considered that you would be unable to cope in the community, were you to be released directly or via a pre-release employment scheme. 5.  the panel did recommend that you be transferred to open conditions. in coming to this conclusion, the panel took into account the length of time you have spent in custody, the opinion of the majority of the report writers and witnesses that the risk you present to the public could be safely managed in open conditions and the fact that the assessment and further work referred to above can be done in open conditions. the panel also took into account that [mrs b] could not say within what period the assessment could be carried out, and the danger of counter-productive stagnation and frustration on your part should you have to spend a further protracted period in category \u2018c\u2019 conditions. 6.  to allow time for assessment and the necessary offence-related work and for your gradual reintegration into the community, the panel considered that your next review should begin in 2 years time.\u201d 21.  by letter dated 7 october 1998, the secretary of state rejected the dlp\u2019s recommendation. he stated that he accepted the psychologist\u2019s view that further work needed to be done in respect of the applicant\u2019s attitude to his original offence, his egocentricity, his intolerance of others, his inability to deal adequately with problems and his lack of responsibility for his actions. he agreed that a full personality assessment was required of the applicant who was still seen as having a psychopathic personality. the secretary of state did not agree that these matters could be safely addressed in open prison conditions. he noted that the applicant had failed to attend further courses in anger management, social skills and communications, as arranged after the secretary of state\u2019s decision of 20 november 1996. he also had regard to an intervening incident which had occurred on 31 july 1998 when the applicant was being escorted to court by a female officer. after she had refused to allow him to smoke in the vehicle, he had slammed the van door against her, causing her to fall and hurt her arm. he had sworn at her, threatening to kill her, adding that he had already killed one woman. the applicant was found guilty under the prison rules of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words. the secretary of state considered that this disclosed impulsive violent behaviour towards a woman over a trivial incident, which had clear similarities with his original offence. he remained an unacceptable risk and was advised that until he co-operated with staff in addressing the areas of concern, the secretary of state saw no justification in allowing him to progress further towards release. it was however agreed that his next review should take place in july 2000. 22.  on 2 february 2000, the applicant\u2019s renewed application for leave to judicially review the dlp\u2019s decision of october 1996, which had been dormant since 21 october 1997, was listed for hearing before the court of appeal. the applicant\u2019s request to amend his grounds of application to add complaints about a lack of independence was refused. the court of appeal rejected his application for leave to apply for judicial review.", "labels": ["5"]}
{"text": "9.  on 13 august 1992, following proceedings on appeal, the arnhem court of appeal (gerechtshof) convicted the applicant of attempted homicide and sentenced him to eight months\u2019 imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre-trial detention. in addition, the court of appeal imposed a tbs order (terbeschikkingstelling) with confinement to a secure institution (met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege). the tbs order took effect on 4 september 1992 and expired two years later, on 4 september 1994. 10.  by decision of 9 september 1994, the arnhem regional court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of arnhem prolonged the tbs order by one year. it was consequently due to expire on 4 september 1995. 11.  on 18 july 1995 the public prosecutor filed a request for a further prolongation with the arnhem regional court, where it was registered on 19 july 1995. this prolongation request was based on an advice of 6 july 1995 by the secure institution where the applicant was being treated. in this advice, a prolongation of the tbs order was recommended because the applicant was still considered capable of being seriously aggressive towards other people. 12.  the regional court examined the request in the course of a hearing held on 22 september 1995. the applicant submitted that the public prosecutor\u2019s request for a prolongation should be declared inadmissible since the regional court was no longer competent to prolong his tbs order as it had expired on 4 september 1995. the applicant further submitted that the regional court had failed to comply with article 509t of the code of criminal procedure (wetboek van strafvordering; hereinafter referred to as \u201cccp\u201d) which provides that a decision on a request for prolongation has to be taken within two months after the submission of the request for prolongation. 13.  in its decision of 6 october 1995, the regional court rejected the applicant\u2019s arguments and prolonged his tbs order with confinement to a secure institution by one more year, taking into account the advice issued by the secure institution where the applicant was being treated and the testimony of an expert witness, recommending that the tbs order should be extended because the applicant was still considered capable of being seriously aggressive towards others. the regional court admitted that the examination of the request had not taken place within the time-limit contained in article 509t ccp and that the reason therefor was the fact that during the holiday months it had not been able to hold sufficient hearings with judges having the specialised knowledge needed. however, it held that a failure to observe the time-limit in article 509t ccp did not imply that the public prosecutor\u2019s request should be declared inadmissible. it noted that the date of the hearing in the instant case had been fixed on 20 july 1995, i.e. within a period of two months after the submission of the prolongation request. it further noted that, by summons of 28 july 1995, the applicant had been invited to appear at the hearing of 22 september 1995 and that a copy of the summons had been sent to his representative. the regional court considered that, if the latter had objected to the fixing of that date, the hearing could have been rescheduled for an earlier date during the recess. the regional court concluded that in all these circumstances the general security of persons required a prolongation of the tbs order. 14.  the applicant filed an appeal with the arnhem court of appeal on 11 october 1995. in the course of a hearing held on 15 january 1996, the court of appeal heard the applicant and a psychologist working in the secure institution where the applicant was under treatment. 15.  in its decision of 29 january 1996, the court of appeal noted that the decision of 6 october 1995 had been taken seventeen days after the expiry of the time-limit provided for in article 509t ccp. it held that the regional court could and should have scheduled a hearing date before the expiry of the time-limit. moreover, article 509t ccp made the regional court responsible and not the applicant or his lawyer to see to it that the time-limit was observed. it further held that failure to observe the time-limit entailed neither the inadmissibility of the prosecution\u2019s request, nor the incompetence of the regional court to examine this request, nor yet the expiry of the tbs order. on the basis of the failure to respect the time-limit referred to in article 509t ccp and the unsatisfactory reasons therefor stated by the regional court, the court of appeal decided to quash the decision of 6 october 1995 and, on appeal, to determine itself the prolongation request. 16.  after having noted the advice of the secure institution where the applicant was receiving treatment and an expert opinion concerning the applicant\u2019s medical condition, the court of appeal decided to extend the tbs order with confinement to a secure institution by one year. 17.  the applicant\u2019s post-sentence confinement, the order was finally terminated on 9 december 2000.", "labels": ["5"]}
{"text": "8.  on 13 january 1993 the applicant was detained on charges of armed robbery, burglary and assault occasioning bodily injuries. 9.  on 13 april 1993 a bill of indictment was lodged with the warsaw regional court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki). the applicant was indicted on the charges of armed robbery, burglary and assault committed together with six other persons. 10.  the court listed hearings for 4, 5 and 6 may 1994 but subsequently cancelled all of them because one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants had failed to appear. on the last of those dates, the hearing was postponed because z.k. (one of the co-defendants) was ill and the court considered it necessary to obtain a medical report determining whether or not he would be able to take part in the trial. the relevant report was received at the court\u2019s registry on 13 june. 11.  two days later the regional court set the trial for 6 and 7 september but, on 6 september, it adjourned the hearings since a court interpreter had failed to appear (d.b., one of the co-defendants, was of lithuanian nationality and therefore not able to follow the trial without the assistance of an interpreter). 12.  the first hearing on the merits was held on 8 november 1994. the court heard evidence from four defendants. the trial continued on 9 and 14 november 1994. in the course of those two hearings, the court heard evidence from other defendants. 13.  the next hearing took place on 16 january 1995. during that hearing the applicant unsuccessfully asked the court to remit the case to the warsaw regional prosecutor and order a further investigation with a view of indicting his wife. on 17 january 1995, in the course of the next hearing, he made a similar application and stated that if it was not granted, he would not attend hearings. later, he apologised for his behaviour. a hearing listed for 18 january started with a delay because it emerged from a medical certificate made by a prison doctor that the applicant was ill. on that day the court however decided to proceed with the trial in the applicant\u2019s absence because, on the basis of another, subsequently obtained medical certificate, it came to the conclusion that he had misinformed the prison authorities as to the state of his health. the trial continued on 19 and 20 january and on 17, 20 and 23 march 1995. further hearings were listed for 17, 18 and 19 may 1995. the hearing set for 18 may did not take place because one of the co-defendants had not appeared before the court. in the meantime, on 8 may 1995, the applicant, relying on his previous record of psychiatric treatment, asked the court to order that he be examined by a psychiatrist. 14.  on 19 may 1995 the court ordered that evidence be obtained from psychiatrists to establish whether tempore criminis the applicant and two of his co-defendants had acted in a state of diminished responsibility. it adjourned the trial to 26 and 27 july 1995. 15.  on 22 may 1995 the court requested the department of forensic psychiatry of warsaw-mokot\u00f3w prison to place the applicant and his co-defendants under psychiatric observation. the applicant underwent that observation from 3 october 1995 to 15 january 1996. 16.  on 29 december 1995, 13 january, 13 and 29 february, 4 march and 16 april 1996, the applicant asked the warsaw regional court to release him. he submitted that his detention on remand had meanwhile exceeded two years and that it was putting a severe strain on his family, especially as his child was ill and his wife and mother needed his help. 17.  the warsaw regional court examined all those applications on 29 april 1996. it dismissed them, holding that the applicant\u2019s detention should continue in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. the court also considered that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention could not in itself be a decisive factor militating in favour of his release. finally, it added that there were no grounds for releasing him in view of his family situation, in particular under article 218 of the code of criminal procedure. in that respect, the court relied on a declaration made by the applicant\u2019s wife (who stated that she did not wish to obtain any help from him). 18.  the applicant appealed, stressing that his detention on remand had meanwhile exceeded three years but his trial had only just commenced. on 23 may 1996 the warsaw court of appeal (s\u0105d apelacyjny) dismissed the appeal in view of the serious nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. 19.  meanwhile, on 29 february 1996 and on an unknown date in april 1996, the psychiatric observations ordered with respect to the applicant\u2019s co-defendants had been completed. the psychiatrists\u2019 reports were received at the court\u2019s registry on 21 march and 12 april 1996, respectively. 20.  on 8 may 1996, the regional court scheduled hearings for 5 and 6 august 1996. it emerged from a subsequent decision of the supreme court (s\u0105d najwy\u017cszy) of 13 february 1997 (see paragraph 26 below) that those hearings had been cancelled because the applicant\u2019s co-defendants had \u201cdisorganised the trial\u201d. in particular, one of them had inflicted injuries on himself. 21.  on 28 may 1996 the applicant challenged the impartiality of the trial court. the challenge was dismissed on 3 june 1996. 22.  on 18 june and 11 september 1996 the applicant made further applications for release. they were dismissed on 4 july and 19 september 1996 respectively. the applicant appealed and, on 28 september 1996, submitted a medical certificate stating that he suffered from gastric ulcers. following inquiries into the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances and his family\u2019s situation made by the relevant courts, the contested decisions were eventually upheld on appeal. the courts reiterated the grounds previously given for the applicant\u2019s continued detention. 23.  on 8 november 1996 the warsaw regional court held a hearing. however, the composition of the panel of the court had to be changed because one of the judges had meanwhile withdrawn from the case. in consequence, the newly-composed trial court had to rehear evidence that had to date been obtained. the trial continued on 12-13, 16 and 18\u201119 december 1996. on 18 december 1996 the court, considering that the applicant behaved in a disorderly manner (he apparently interrupted the process of obtaining evidence from experts) ordered that he be temporarily removed from the court room. a hearing listed for 21 january 1997 was postponed to 4 february because one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants had failed to appear. in the course of the hearing held on 4 february 1997 the applicant for the second time challenged the impartiality of the trial court. 24.  on 21 january 1997 the applicant asked the court to release him. on 6 february 1997 he lodged another application for release. the court dealt with his applications on 3 march 1997 and dismissed them, holding that there were no grounds for releasing him under article 218 of the code of criminal procedure 25.  in the meantime, on 31 december 1996, the warsaw regional court had made an application under article 222 \u00a7 4 of the code of criminal procedure to the supreme court, asking it to prolong the applicant\u2019s and his co-defendants\u2019 detention on remand until 30 may 1997, i.e. beyond the statutory time-limit set in such cases. the regional court considered that the prolonged psychiatric observation of three of the co-defendants, the need to obtain evidence and the fact that one co-defendant had gone on a hunger strike and had inflicted injuries on himself fully justified the opinion that the defendants had deliberately obstructed the termination of the proceedings within the statutory time-limit and, consequently, gave sufficient grounds for extending their detention. referring to the applicant, the court held that he had, by his conduct, obstructed the termination of the proceedings.  it did not specify how the applicant prevented completion of the trial. 26.  the supreme court examined that application on 13 february 1997. it prolonged the applicant\u2019s and his co-defendants\u2019 detention on remand until 30 april 1997. 27.  the trial was to continue on 7 march 1997 but \u2013 for unknown reasons \u2013 it was postponed to a later date. 28.  on 21 march 1997 the applicant \u2013 again unsuccessfully \u2013 challenged the impartiality of the trial court. 29.  the trial continued on 1, 4 and 16 april 1997. on 18 april 1997 the court gave judgment. the applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to eleven years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 polish zlotys. 30.  the applicant appealed against his first-instance conviction in july 1997. the warsaw court of appeal dismissed the appeal on 2 december 1997.", "labels": ["5", "6"]}
{"text": "7.  on 19 october 1992 the applicant lent to mjb, a company in zagreb, 10,000 german marks (dem) for a period of three months at a rate of interest of 27%. on 23 november 1992 she lent to zip, a company in zagreb, dem 20,390 for a period of one month at a rate of interest of 20%. 8.  as the said companies failed to repay the loans, the applicant instituted proceedings against zip and mjb in the zagreb municipal court (op\u0107inski sud u zagrebu). 9.  the proceedings against zip and its alleged owner \u017e.m. commenced on 29 march 1995 when the applicant, together with thirty-nine other plaintiffs, filed an action for repayment of their loans. 10.  on 17 may 1995 the court asked the applicant\u2019s counsel to provide the address of the second defendant. on 23 may 1995 the applicant\u2019s counsel submitted the address concerned. 11.  a hearing was scheduled for 4 october 1995 but it was adjourned since the defendants failed to appear. it turned out that the defendants had not received notice of the date of the hearing as the address indicated was incorrect. the court asked the applicant\u2019s counsel to submit the defendants\u2019 correct address within thirty days. 12.  the next hearing was scheduled for 24 january 1996. however, it appears that in the meantime zip had ceased to exist and, as \u017e.m.\u2019s address remained unknown, the court ordered the applicant\u2019s counsel to request the social welfare centre (centar za socijalnu skrb) to appoint a legal representative for \u017e.m. 13.  on 20 june 1996 the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the court that the zagreb social welfare centre had, by its decision of 11 march 1996, appointed a legal representative for \u017e.m. 14.  on 13 september 1996 the court asked the applicant\u2019s counsel to submit within thirty days a certificate from the registry of the zagreb commercial court (trgova\u010dki sud u zagrebu) concerning the legal status of zip. 15.  the next hearing, scheduled for 2 december 1999, was also adjourned due to the absence of the defendants. it turned out again that zip and \u017e.m. had not received notice of the hearing date as the address indicated was incorrect. the court invited the applicant\u2019s counsel to inform it within thirty days whether zip had in fact ceased to exist. 16.  according to the government, during the next hearing on 7 june 2000, the court decided upon the parties\u2019 application to return the proceedings to the status quo ante (zahtjev za povrat u prija\u0161nje stanje). due to the absence of zip the hearing was adjourned to 17 october 2000. it appears that the proceedings are still pending before the zagreb municipal court. 17.  the proceedings against mjb and its alleged owner b.j. commenced on 30 march 1995 when the applicant, together with thirty other plaintiffs, filed an action for repayment of their loans with the zagreb municipal court. 18.  the court asked the applicant\u2019s counsel to provide the address of b.j. on 25 august 1995 the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the court of b.j.\u2019s address. 19.  the hearing scheduled for 2 october 1995 was adjourned due to the absence of the defendants. it turned out that mjb was no longer at its previous address and that b.j. was in detention on remand. the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the court that b.j. had been released from detention and requested that the notices for the next hearing be sent to the defendants at the same addresses as before. 20.  the hearing on 27 november 1995 was again adjourned due to the defendants\u2019 absence. it appears that mjb had in the meantime ceased to exist and that b.j. had changed her address. the court invited the applicant\u2019s counsel to inform it within thirty days whether mjb had in fact ceased to exist and of the correct address of b.j. 21.  on 7 december 1995 the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the court of the defendants\u2019 addresses. 22.  the next hearing, on 14 february 1996, was also adjourned due to the defendants\u2019 absence for the same reasons as before, that is that mjb had ceased to exist and that b.j. had changed address. the court decided to look into the criminal case file no. ko-1574/93 in the same court, where criminal proceedings had been instituted against b.j., in order to obtain her proper address. through that the court found her address. 23.  by order of 11 september 1996 the applicant\u2019s counsel was requested to furnish the court with a certificate from the registry of the zagreb commercial court regarding the legal status of mjb. 24.  on 20 september 1996 the applicant\u2019s counsel submitted the requested document. 25.  the next hearing, scheduled for 7 november 1997, was adjourned due to the defendants\u2019 absence. the documents indicate that they had not received the notice of the hearing date. 26.  the next hearing, scheduled for 26 january 1998, was adjourned for the same reason. the court invited the applicant\u2019s counsel to submit b.j.\u2019s correct address within sixty days. 27.  on 6 february 1998 the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the court that in the police registry b.j.\u2019s address was the same as before. he proposed that a legal representative be appointed for b.j. 28.  on 13 february 1998 the court ordered the applicant\u2019s counsel to request the social welfare centre to appoint a legal representative for b.j. 29.  on 2 april 1998 the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the court that the zagreb social welfare centre had, by its decision of 26 march 1998, appointed a legal representative for b.j. 30.  according to the government, during the next hearing, on 2 july 1998, the court issued a default judgment (presuda zbog izostanka) against b.j. the available documents show that mjb had ceased to exist. 31.  on 22 july 1998 the court sent a letter to the zagreb commercial court asking for a certificate regarding the legal status of mjb. on 24 september 1998 the court received a letter from the zagreb commercial court with a certificate that wrongly contained information about another firm, instead of mjb. 32.  on 13 april 2000 the court again sent a letter to the zagreb commercial court asking whether mjb still existed. on the same day the court also requested the applicant\u2019s counsel to submit the same information. it appears that the case is still pending before the zagreb municipal court.", "labels": ["6"]}
{"text": "9.  on 4 october 1993 the applicant was arrested on charges of forgery of documents and fraud in connection with a criminal investigation that had been opened on 10 september 1993. \nit was alleged that the applicant, with the assistance of a customs officer and two other accomplices, had made false customs declarations certifying fictitious exports of consignments of cigarettes which in reality had been sold on the domestic market. on the basis of the false declarations the applicant had obtained the reimbursement of some excise tax and had attempted to obtain further reimbursements. the total amount involved, for which the applicant was eventually found guilty (see paragraph 33 below), was 15,230,400 old bulgarian levs (\u201cbgl\u201d) (about 3,000,000 french francs (\u201cfrf\u201d) at the time).\nthe charges preferred against the applicant were based on section 212 \u00a7 4 of the penal code, which provided for a sentence of ten to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. 10.  during the preliminary investigation the case file was transmitted twice from the plovdiv investigator\u2019s office to the plovdiv regional court so that the appeals against detention could be examined. the case file was thus unavailable to the investigator and the supervising prosecutor for twelve days (between 28 october and 9 november 1993) and for a further four days (between 28 february and 2 march 1994). 11.  the preliminary investigation was concluded on 5 april 1994 when the indictment drawn up by the prosecutor was submitted to the plovdiv regional court. 12.  the plovdiv regional court sat as a chamber of three judges: a president who was a professional judge and two lay judges.\nit held its first hearing on 12 and 13 may 1994 when the four accused and several witnesses were heard. the prosecutor and the defence lawyers requested permission to submit further evidence. the court adjourned the hearing. 13.  several times during the proceedings the regional court had to wait for the case file to be returned by the supreme court in sofia, where it had been sent for the examination of the appeals submitted by the applicant and his co-accused against the regional court\u2019s refusals to release them on bail. in practice, whenever such an appeal was submitted, the plovdiv regional court transmitted the case file together with the appeal and a prosecutor\u2019s opinion. 14.  the case file was sent to the supreme court on 28 may 1994 for one of the co-accused\u2019s appeal against detention to be examined and was returned on 30 june 1994.\nthe regional court did not deal with the case until 13 september 1994, when the presiding judge ordered the production of a piece of evidence. 15.  the next hearing was held on 6 october 1994. the court heard several witnesses and adjourned the hearing as the prosecutor insisted on the examination of other witnesses who had not appeared. some of them were ordered to pay fines for their failure to appear. the court further decided to seek the assistance of the police to establish the addresses of other witnesses who could not be found. 16.  the hearing resumed on 29 and 30 november 1994. several witnesses and experts were heard. both the prosecution and the defence sought to adduce additional evidence. the hearing was adjourned. 17.  between 20 january and 21 february 1995 the case file was in sofia at the supreme court for the examination of appeals against detention. 18.  the hearing listed for 19 april 1995 was adjourned as the presiding judge was ill. the next hearing, scheduled for 9 june 1995, was adjourned as one of the lay judges had been taken ill. 19.  on 12 july 1995 the court sitting in private ordered an expert report.\nthe hearing listed for 21 september 1995 was adjourned owing to the illness of the lawyer of one of the co-accused. 20.  between 3 october and 6 november 1995 the case file was in sofia at the supreme court, which was examining appeals against detention. 21.  the next hearing, listed for 12 january 1996, had to be adjourned as both lay judges were ill. 22.  after learning that the lay judges were prevented by ill health from further participation in the proceedings, on 19 february 1996 the plovdiv regional court recommenced the examination of the case with two new lay judges. 23.  the new chamber of the court held a hearing on 26 and 27 march 1996 which was adjourned as some of the witnesses had not been summoned due to an omission on the part of the court\u2019s clerk and because the parties sought to adduce further evidence. the court fixed the date for the next hearing to 7 and 8 may 1996. 24.  on 7 and 8 may 1996 the court heard several witnesses and an expert. the hearing was adjourned as further evidence had to be obtained. 25.  between 9 and 28 may 1996 the case file was at the supreme court in sofia in connection with appeals against detention. 26.  the hearing scheduled for 16 and 17 september 1996 was adjourned to 29 and 30 october 1996 as a lay judge had broken his leg and was unable to attend. 27.  on 29 october 1996 the parties to the criminal case, including the applicant who at that time was on hunger strike, appeared before the plovdiv regional court. the lawyers requested an adjournment in view of the applicant\u2019s health and the absence of the witnesses and of a defence lawyer. the court heard the medical experts who had been appointed the previous day and had examined the applicant briefly. the experts stated that the applicant needed to undergo a full examination in hospital. on 30 october 1996 the court ordered the applicant\u2019s temporary admission to hospital and adjourned the hearing. the parties disagreed over the reasons for this adjournment. the applicant submits that the absence of several witnesses was decisive, whereas the government maintain that the only reason was the applicant\u2019s state of health, as the medical experts considered that he was not well enough to participate in the hearing. 28.  between 19 november and 4 december 1996 the case file was in sofia at the supreme court in connection with appeals against detention. in its cover letter to the supreme court, the regional court drew attention to the fact that a hearing had been listed for 19 december 1996 and called for the return of the case file before that date. 29.  the hearing resumed on 19 december 1996. one witness was examined. as other witnesses had not appeared, the court accepted the requests of the defence lawyers and the prosecutor for a further adjournment. 30.  with two exceptions, the plovdiv regional court did not, when adjourning hearings, announce in open court a date for the resumed hearing. as a result, certain witnesses and experts who were present but had to be heard again were informed about the date of the resumed hearing by a summons to attend. if the summons did not reach the person concerned the examination of the case could not be completed at the resumed hearing.\nin particular, the witnesses mrs m. h. and mr s. z. were present at the hearing on 13 may 1994, but were not duly summoned for the hearing on 29 november 1994. the witness mr g.p. was present at the hearing on 26 march 1996 but was not duly summoned for the hearing on 7 may 1996. that latter hearing was adjourned to allow the examination of witnesses who had not appeared. 31.  the regional court throughout the proceedings sought police assistance to establish the addresses of witnesses and bring them before the court. one of the witnesses was suspected of seeking to evade service of the summonses. 32.  the last hearing before the plovdiv regional court took place on 28\u201131 january 1997. the court heard witnesses and the submissions of the parties to the criminal case and examined other evidence. the applicant apparently unsuccessfully requested the adjournment of the hearing in order to question four absent witnesses whose attendance had previously been requested by both parties. 33.  on 31 january 1997 the regional court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to thirteen years\u2019 imprisonment. his accomplices were also convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of between eleven and twelve years. the court reserved the reasoning of its judgment. it was prepared on an unspecified date at least three months following the delivery of the judgment. 34.  on 10 february 1997 the applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the supreme court of cassation, which under the relevant law was acting as an appellate court in cases such as the applicant\u2019s.\nthe supreme court of cassation listed the case for hearing on 26 september 1997. on that date the prosecutor appointed to act before the supreme court of cassation declared that he used to know one of the convicted persons and wished to withdraw. the court adjourned the hearing. 35.  the hearing was held on 23 january 1998. on 18 march 1998 the supreme court of cassation upheld the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence. 36.  up to that point the applicant had been represented by a lawyer and, at times, by two or three lawyers simultaneously. 37.  on 24 march 1998 one of the persons convicted at the same trial instituted review (cassation) proceedings.\nthe five-member chamber of the supreme court of cassation held a hearing on 10 june 1998 at which the applicant appeared without legal representation. he expressed the wish to join the review (cassation) proceedings, which was still possible as the statutory time-limit had not expired. the court adjourned the hearing to enable the applicant to file a petition for review (cassation) and arrange for his legal representation. the applicant lodged a petition for review on 22 june 1998. 38.  the hearing resumed on 9 december 1998.\nby judgment of 22 march 1999 the supreme court of cassation dismissed the applicant\u2019s petition for review (cassation). 39.  on 4 october 1993, the day of his arrest, the applicant was brought before an investigator, who decided to detain him on remand. this decision was approved by a prosecutor on the same date.\non 14 october 1993, when the case was at the preliminary investigation stage, the applicant appealed to the plovdiv regional court against his detention on remand. the court examined the case in private, on the basis of the investigator\u2019s file, the applicant\u2019s petition and the prosecutor\u2019s comments, which were not communicated to the applicant. by a decision of 3 november 1993 the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. 40.  one of the applicant\u2019s accomplices, a mr h., was released on bail on 6 november 1993, but was re-arrested on 15 february 1994. while on bail mr h. attempted to induce mr g., a witness, to give false evidence, and was later charged with and convicted of that offence. 41.  following the conclusion of the preliminary investigation in the applicant\u2019s case, and after his committal in april 1994 for trial, the applicant made before the plovdiv regional court seven applications for release on bail. appeals were made to the supreme court against some of the decisions of the regional court. 42.  the first of those seven bail applications was made on 3 october 1994 and dismissed by the regional court on 6 october 1994.\nanother request, made on an unspecified date, was dismissed by the regional court on 30 november 1994. the regional court\u2019s refusal to release the applicant was confirmed by the supreme court on 21 february 1995. 43.  in its decision of 21 february 1995 the supreme court stated that under article 152 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the code of criminal procedure detention on remand was mandatory for everyone accused of a crime punishable by ten or more years\u2019 imprisonment, the only exception being where it was clear beyond doubt that there was no danger of the accused\u2019s absconding or re-offending. in the supreme court\u2019s view such would only be the case where, for example, the accused was seriously ill, elderly or in any other condition which excluded the danger of his or her absconding or re-offending. since the applicant was charged with a crime punishable by more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment and as no special circumstances excluding the danger of his absconding or re-offending had been established, there were no grounds for ordering his release on bail. the supreme court referred to its practice on the matter.\nthe supreme court further refused to consider the applicant\u2019s contention that the evidence against him was weak. it found that it had no jurisdiction to do so in connection with a bail application. its only task was to examine whether the conditions for detention on remand under article 152 of the code of criminal procedure had been met. 44.  the applicant again applied for his release on bail on 11 july 1995. that application was dismissed by the regional court on 21 september 1995. on appeal, the regional court\u2019s refusal to release the applicant was upheld by the supreme court sitting in private on 6 november 1995, upon receipt of the prosecutor\u2019s observations which had not been communicated to the applicant. the supreme court stated that the applicant could only be released if there existed unequivocal evidence establishing beyond all doubt that there was no danger of his absconding, re-offending or obstructing the investigation. however, no such evidence was available in the applicant\u2019s case.\nby a decision of 4 december 1995 the regional court refused the applicant\u2019s request, submitted on an unspecified date, to annul or revise its previous decision concerning his detention on remand. addressing the applicant\u2019s argument that the material in the case indicated that he had not committed a crime, the court stated that it was not open to it to analyse the evidence in the criminal proceedings. the lawfulness of the detention was to be gauged on the basis of the accusation against the applicant. the only other element to be examined was whether or not there existed exceptional circumstances demonstrating beyond all doubt that there was not even a hypothetical danger of his absconding, re-offending or obstructing the investigation. however the court had already found that no such circumstances existed. 45.  a further request for release on bail, submitted on 15 january 1996, was refused by the regional court on 20 february 1996 as there had been no change in the circumstances.\nat the hearing on 27 march 1996 before the regional court the applicant made an oral request for release. this was refused that same day. the court stated that there had been no change of circumstances and that the law did not lay down a time-limit for detention on remand. 46.  on 1 april 1996 the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged an appeal to the supreme court against the decision of 27 march 1996. three days later, on 4 april 1996, the applicant also appealed in person. the appeals were submitted through the regional court, in accordance with the established practice. the grounds for appeal were, inter alia, that all evidence in the criminal case had already been examined and that therefore there was no danger of the applicant\u2019s perverting the course of justice. furthermore, there was no danger of his absconding, as he had been abroad when the investigation had started and had returned voluntarily. he had never been convicted of a criminal offence, had a family and a permanent residence. the applicant also stated that the length of his detention violated the convention. 47.  by a decision of 9 april 1996 delivered in private the regional court, before transmitting the appeals of 1 and 4 april 1996 to the supreme court, confirmed its refusal of 27 march 1996 to release the applicant. the regional court stated inter alia that the applicant\u2019s arguments could not, under the settled practice of the supreme court, serve as a basis for a decision to release him. 48.  the applicant\u2019s appeals of 1 and 4 april 1996 were transmitted to the supreme court on 9 may 1996. on 10 may 1996 the applicant lodged a further appeal against the regional court\u2019s refusal to release him. it was joined to the two earlier appeals. 49.  on 22 may 1996 a prosecutor of the chief public prosecutor\u2019s office lodged written submissions on the appeals with the supreme court, inviting it to dismiss them. the submissions were not communicated to the applicant.\non 28 may 1996 the supreme court dismissed the appeals. it found that under article 152 \u00a7 1 of the code of criminal procedure the applicant\u2019s detention on remand was justified and that the case before it did not come within the exception provided by article 152 \u00a7 2 of the code.\nthe court also stated that the length of the proceedings and the question whether the accusations were well-founded were irrelevant. 50.  on 15 october 1996 the applicant lodged a further application for release on bail. at that time he was on hunger strike which he had commenced on 23 september 1996 to protest against his continuing detention on remand.\nthe presiding judge noted on 23 october 1996 that the court could not hear the appeal as one of the lay judges had been taken ill.\nat the hearing of 29 and 30 october 1996 the applicant renewed his application.\nthe regional court heard medical experts who had examined the applicant and it dismissed his application of 30 october 1996. 51.  on 6 november 1996 the applicant\u2019s lawyers lodged an appeal against the decision of 30 october 1996.\non 11 november 1996, before transmitting the appeal to the supreme court, the regional court sitting in private confirmed its decision of 30 october 1996. it found inter alia that there had been no change of circumstances except for the applicant\u2019s worsening health. however, the medical experts had not stated that his release was necessary and his condition was being constantly monitored in hospital. 52.  on 19 november 1996 the appeal was transmitted to the supreme court.\non 25 november 1996 a prosecutor of the chief public prosecutor\u2019s office submitted written observations to the supreme court, inviting it to dismiss the appeal. the comments were not communicated to the applicant. 53.  on 4 december 1996 the supreme court sitting in private dismissed the appeal. it stated, inter alia, that the danger of absconding, re-offending and perverting the course of justice was presumed in view of the gravity of the crime with which the applicant was charged. the applicant\u2019s health problems, which could be dealt with at the place of detention, and the length of his detention \u2011 despite its inevitable negative consequences \u2011 did not affect that finding. the court further considered that the applicant\u2019s complaints

{"text": "8.  since 1967 the applicant company has owned approximately 65,000 square metres of land in the municipality of pomezia, entered in the land register as folio 11, parcel 66. in 1963 the pomezia district council had given its approval for a building project to be carried out on the land. 9.  on 29 december 1967 the pomezia district council resolved to adopt a general development plan (piano regolatore generale \u2013 \u201cgdp\u201d). 10.  on 20 november 1974 the lazio regional council approved the gdp for pomezia, which set aside the applicant company\u2019s land for the creation of a public park (parco pubblico) and, consequently, imposed an absolute prohibition on building on the land with a view to its expropriation. 11.  pursuant to section 2 of law no. 1187/1968, the prohibition on building imposed by the gdp lapsed in 1979, no detailed development plan having been adopted in the intervening five years. 12.  despite the fact that the prohibition on building had lapsed, the applicant company\u2019s land did not revert to its original use. 13.  pending a decision by the pomezia district council on its future use, the land was subject to the regulations in section 4 of law no. 10/1977, a provision which the courts had held to apply in situations of that kind (see paragraphs 38-40 below), and, from 1990, to the regulations in law no. 86 of the lazio region. 14.  the applicant company\u2019s land was consequently affected by the building restrictions deriving from the application of these laws. 15.  on 12 march 1987 the applicant company asked the pomezia district council to determine the use to which the land was to be put. no action was taken on this request. 16.  in view of the district council\u2019s failure to reply, which amounted to a refusal, the applicant company appealed to the regional administrative court (\u201cthe rac\u201d). it argued, firstly, that the district council was under an obligation to determine the intended use of the land and that its inaction was unlawful. it also sought to have the land designated as building land by the authorities. 17.  in a decision of 16 october 1989 the lazio rac allowed the applicant company\u2019s appeal in so far as it acknowledged that the pomezia district council\u2019s inaction was unlawful. 18.  the court held that the prohibition on building imposed in 1974 had ceased to be effective after five years, pursuant to law no. 1187/1968, because the pomezia district council had not adopted a detailed development plan. since then, the applicant company\u2019s land had been subject to the regulations in law no. 10/1977. the court considered, however, that the building restrictions deriving from the application of that law could not take the place of an actual decision by the administrative authorities as to the intended use of the land; the authorities were consequently under an obligation to revise the land-use plan (ricostituzione della disciplina urbanistica), and their inaction was unlawful. however, the district council remained entirely at liberty to determine the use to which the land in issue should be put; the rac was not empowered to direct that the land should be given a particular designation. 19.  in conclusion, the rac ordered the administrative authorities to give a fresh decision as to the intended use of the applicant company\u2019s land. 20.  the pomezia district council appealed against that decision. 21.  in a decision of 28 february 1992 the consiglio di stato dismissed the pomezia district council\u2019s appeal and upheld the impugned decision. 22.  on 10 september 1992, in view of the failure of the pomezia district council to comply with the consiglio di stato\u2019s judgment, the applicant company requested the district council to adopt a decision on the land. it also proposed a solution whereby if the district council designated 15,000 square metres as building land, the applicant company would assign the rest of the land to the municipality free of charge. no action was taken on this proposal. 23.  in a decision of 25 october 1995 the pomezia district council resolved to adopt a detailed development plan and again imposed an absolute prohibition on building on the applicant company\u2019s land with a view to its expropriation. the district council set the land aside for public use. 24.  the applicant company appealed against that decision to the regional committee for supervision of measures taken by municipal authorities (coreco), seeking to have the district council\u2019s decision overturned. it argued that the indications given as to the intended use of the land were too vague and that the conditions for renewing the prohibition on building, such as that of public interest, were not satisfied. the outcome of the appeal is not known. 25.  it appears from the expert opinion produced by the applicant company that the detailed development plan imposing a prohibition on building on the land was adopted on 22 march 1999.", "labels": ["P1-1"]}

27 april 1994 the applicant was convicted by the z\u00fcrich district office (statthalteramt) of the unlawful possession of weapons. 9.  according to the charges subsequently raised against the applicant, he committed, on 28 april 1994 in z\u00fcrich, the offences of robbery and damage to property by attacking a man, together with another person, at 1 a.m., by throwing him to the ground, kicking him in the face and taking 1,201 swiss francs from him. 10.  the z\u00fcrich district court (bezirksgericht) convicted the applicant of these offences on 17 may 1995, though the judgment was quashed upon appeal as the applicant had not been represented by a lawyer. proceedings were resumed before the district court, which on 1 july 1996 sentenced the applicant to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment, suspended on probation. 11.  both the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the applicant filed an appeal, whereupon on 31 january 1997 the court of appeal (obergericht) of the canton of z\u00fcrich sentenced the applicant to two years\u2019 unconditional imprisonment for robbery and damage to property. in its judgment the court considered that the applicant had been particularly ruthless and brutal, and that his culpability (verschulden) was severe. 12.  the applicant\u2019s further plea of nullity was dismissed on 17 november 1997 by the court of cassation (kassationsgericht) of the canton of z\u00fcrich. 13.  on 11 may 1998 the applicant began his two-year prison sentence. 14.  on 19 may 1998 the directorate for social matters and security (direktion f\u00fcr soziales und sicherheit) of the canton of z\u00fcrich refused to renew the applicant\u2019s residence permit (aufenthaltsbewilligung). 15.  the applicant\u2019s appeal against this decision was dismissed by the government (regierungsrat) of the canton of z\u00fcrich on 21 october 1998. 16.  in a written statement of 18 november 1998, the applicant\u2019s wife complained of being expected to follow her husband to algeria. while admitting that she spoke french, she claimed that she would have no work in algeria and no money. she found it most shocking that a married couple was being separated. 17.  the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of 21 october 1998 was dismissed by the administrative court (verwaltungsgericht) of the canton of z\u00fcrich on 16 june 1999. in its decision, the court relied for the non-renewal of the applicant\u2019s residence permit in particular on sections 7 and 11 of the federal aliens\u2019 domicile and residence act (bundesgesetz \u00fcber aufenthalt und niederlassung der ausl\u00e4nder) and on article 16 \u00a7 3 of the ordinance implementing the act (vollziehungsverordnung). the court considered that the non-renewal was called for in the interests of public order and security. it might well separate the applicant from his wife, though they could live together in another country, or visit each other. 18.  on 2 august 1999 the applicant was given early release from prison. 19.  the applicant\u2019s administrative-law appeal (verwaltungsgerichts- beschwerde) against the decision of 21 october 1998 was dismissed by the federal court (bundesgericht) on 3 november 1999. the court recalled that according to section 10(1) of the federal aliens\u2019 domicile and residence act the criminal conviction of a foreigner served as a ground for expulsion. there was no breach of article 8 of the convention as the authorities refused to renew the applicant\u2019s residence permit in view of the serious offence which he had committed. the measure was imposed in the interests of public order and security. the fact that he had behaved well in prison was irrelevant as this did not concern his conduct outside. 20.  the federal court\u2019s noted that a large number of the applicant\u2019s relations lived in algeria, and that he had not demonstrated particularly close links with switzerland. while it would not be easy for his wife to follow him to algeria, this was not completely impossible. indeed, she spoke french and had been able to have some contact by telephone with her mother-in-law. the couple could also live in italy, where the applicant had spent some time before coming to switzerland. 21.  by a decision of 1 december 1999 the federal aliens\u2019 office (bundesamt f\u00fcr ausl\u00e4nderfragen) issued an order prohibiting the applicant from entering switzerland as of 15 january 2000 for an unspecified period of time (auf unbestimmte dauer). by a decision of 3 december 1999 the office ordered the applicant to leave switzerland by 15 january 2000. 22.  on an unspecified date in 2000 the applicant left switzerland and is currently living in italy. 23.  in december 1997 the applicant passed a training course to become a waiter. from 20 august 1997 until 21 january 1998 he worked as a painter for an organisation for refugees in z\u00fcrich. 24.  while the applicant was serving his prison sentence at the ringwil prison colony in hinwil, the prison services issued an interim report on 12 november 1998 on his conduct, according to which his work as a gardener and stable-hand had been satisfactory. the report also stated that he had good manners and a very agreeable personality; that his room was always tidy; that as a rule he returned punctually from his leave; and that various urine tests for detecting drugs had all shown negative results. 25.  according to a work report from the c. company, dated 28 february 2000, the applicant had been working satisfactorily with that company since 3 may 1999 as an assistant gardener and electrician. a work report from the v. company, dated december 1999, stated that the applicant had worked well as an assistant gardener for that company for eighteen weeks between may and november 1999. 26.  according to a letter from the italian ministry of the interior to the swiss embassy in rome, dated 20

{"text": "8.  on 28 february 1995 detective inspector mann (d.i. mann), received information that an armed robbery of a securicor ltd cash-collection van was going to be committed on or around 2 march 1995 by the first applicant and b. at one of several possible locations. the police knew where b. lived and began visual surveillance of those same premises the same day. d.i. mann learnt that b. was suspected of being a drug dealer and that surveillance operations mounted against b. in the past had proved unsuccessful because they had been compromised. it was therefore concluded that b. was \u201csurveillance-conscious\u201d. b. was suspected of being responsible for the shooting of a police officer with a shotgun in the course of a robbery. this was something that all the officers, and particularly the chief constable, were aware of when the police operation was being planned. 9.  no robbery took place on 2 march 1995. by 3 march 1995, however, the police had received further information that the robbery was to take place \u201csomewhere\u201d on 9 march 1995. further information as to the location or target of the proposed robbery could not be obtained on 3 march 1995. in order to obtain further details about the proposed robbery, d.i. mann prepared a report for the chief constable in support of an application for authorisation to install a covert listening device in b.\u2019s flat. some of the contents of this report were the subject of a successful application for non-disclosure by the crown on the ground that serious damage would be caused to the public interest were they to be made public. 10.  the use of covert listening devices was governed by the \u201cguidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations\u201d issued by the home office in 1984 (\u201cthe guidelines\u201d). on 3 march 1995 the chief constable decided that the use of such a device was justified under the guidelines but would not authorise its use until he was satisfied that its installation was feasible. reconnaissance during the night of 3/4 march established that it was feasible. 11.  on 4 march 1995 the chief constable gave oral authorisation to proceed with its use. however, he did not provide written confirmation as required by the guidelines because he was on annual leave, so he gave the authority by telephone from home. the chief constable stated that the use of the device was to be reviewed on a daily basis. he said that he had asked the deputy chief constable to look after the written formalities and to ensure, inter alia, that there was written confirmation of the message that the installation of the device was feasible. he did not receive this confirmation until 8 march. on 8 march 1995 the deputy chief constable gave \u201cretrospective\u201d written authorisation for use of the listening device. 12.  on 4 march a covert listening device was therefore installed in a sofa in b.\u2019s flat before the deputy chief constable had confirmed the authorisation in writing. conversations between b. and others in b.\u2019s living room were monitored and recorded until 15 march 1995. 13.  on 14 march 1995 the police made a request to bt (british telecommunications plc) for itemised billing in relation to the telephone number of b. at his flat for the period from 1 january 1995 to the date of the request. the data-protection form was countersigned by a police superintendent in line with bt\u2019s requirements, stating that the information was necessary to assist in the identification of members of a team of suspected armed robbers. while the request was originally made in an effort to identify the unknown third person in the conspiracy (now known to have been the second applicant), the data was also used later in court to corroborate the times and dates recorded by the officers in respect of the covert listening device in the flat. 14.  on 15 march 1995 b. and others who were with him in his home discovered the listening device and abandoned the premises. the robbery did not take place. the police had been continuing their visual surveillance of the premises, taking photographs and video footage whilst the audio surveillance was in progress. the applicants were identified by various officers going in and out of the flat and observed on some occasions to be carrying various hold-alls. the police had also been keeping watch on a cache in a rural location and observed the first applicant collecting an item from this location on the evening of 15 march 1995. an officer had earlier inspected the hidden item, which he stated he could tell through the plastic bag was a revolver. it appeared that the vehicle which the first applicant used for transport that evening was a stolen vehicle in which he was subsequently arrested. 15.  on 16 march 1995 the applicants were arrested in the stolen vauxhall car. in the boot of the vehicle were found two hold-alls containing, inter alia, two black balaclavas, five black plastic cable ties, two pairs of leather gloves and two army kitbags. following legal advice, the applicants declined to comment during interview and refused to provide speech samples to the police. the police obtained a search warrant for the flat and searched it. fingerprints of the applicants were found, as well as items such as a pair of overalls and a third balaclava. three vehicles were recovered and examined. the items retained included balaclavas, hold-alls, overalls and a broken petrol cap. 16.  as they wished to obtain speech samples to compare with the tapes, the police applied for authorisation to install covert listening devices in the cells being used by the applicants and to attach covert listening devices to the police officers who were to be present when the applicants were charged and when their antecedents were examined. written authorisation was given by the chief constable in accordance with the home office guidelines. samples of the applicants\u2019 speech were recorded without their knowledge or permission. in the case of the second applicant, the conversations that were recorded included, on one occasion, the second applicant taking advice from his solicitor. the government state that, when the police officer realised what the conversation was about, it was not listened to. that recording was not adduced in evidence at trial. 17.  the voice samples of the applicants were sent to an expert who compared them with the voices on the taped recordings of conversations held in b.\u2019s home between 4 and 15 march. the expert concluded that it was \u201clikely\u201d that the first applicant\u2019s voice featured on the taped recordings and that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that the second applicant\u2019s voice featured on them. 18.  b. and the applicants were charged with conspiracy to rob securicor ltd of monies. b. pleaded guilty in view of the house of lords decision in r. v. khan ([1996] 3 all england law reports 289). the house of lords held in that case that relevant evidence was admissible notwithstanding that it had been obtained by unlawful means (for example, trespass). the applicants, however, challenged the admissibility of the evidence derived from the use of the covert listening devices at b.\u2019s home on two grounds.\n(a)  the chief constable should not have authorised the use of a covert listening device at b.\u2019s premises because other forms of investigation had not been tried and failed as required by paragraph 4 (b) of the guidelines, with the result that it would be unfair to admit evidence which ought never to have been obtained.\n(b)  the covert listening device had been installed and used before written confirmation of the chief constable\u2019s authorisation had been received and there was no specific permission for the recordings obtained from the device to be used in evidence.\nbefore the jury was sworn in at the trial, judge brodrick heard evidence by means of a voir dire (submissions on a point of law in the absence of the jury) on matters relating to the admissibility of the challenged evidence. the prosecution conceded that the relevant evidence had been obtained by unlawful means, namely trespass. during this procedure the prosecution claimed that the public interest was likely to be damaged if certain disclosures were made and certain evidence given, in other words claiming public interest immunity. the prosecution argued that the test of admissibility was relevance. the defence argued that the judge had the discretion to exclude the evidence under section 78 of the police and criminal evidence act 1984 (pace), and that he should do so because the chief constable had failed to abide by the guidelines. 19.  judge brodrick decided that some documents, including d.i. mann\u2019s report, which led to the chief constable\u2019s decision to authorise the use and installation of a covert listening device in b.\u2019s flat, were to be withheld from the applicants and their lawyers. the judge kept under review the non-disclosure during the proceedings and at one point some disclosure was made, although not d.i. mann\u2019s report in its entirety. d.i. mann also declined to answer questions put to him in cross-examination by defence counsel on the ground that it might reveal sensitive material. judge brodrick asked defence counsel whether they wanted him to put the unanswered questions to d.i. mann under oath, in chambers, and they agreed. the judge proceeded to put the questions to d.i. mann in private in the absence of the applicants and their lawyers. he heard evidence from d.i. mann concerning the ability of the police to \u201ccontrol\u201d b. in order to install the device in the flat, which the defence asserted indicated that normal methods of surveillance would have been possible. he also heard d.i. mann concerning the arrangements made and put into effect for this period. the answers to those questions were not divulged, the judge indicating in open court that the benefit to the defence from the answers given was slight, if any at all, while the damage to the public interest if the answers were made public would be great. accordingly, he held that d.i. mann was entitled on public immunity grounds to refuse to answer those questions. 20.  judge brodrick rejected the applicants\u2019 challenge to the admissibility of the evidence derived from the covert listening devices in b\u2019s flat. in reaching his decision, judge brodrick stated:\n\u201c61.  it follows that i must apply the test set out in section 78 on the basis that this was a properly authorised decision to install the device and that the police were justified in continuing to use it up to the moment when it was discovered. at most there were one or possibly two breaches of procedure, but neither, in my judgment, could be described as either significant or substantial. it is conceded by the crown that the installation of the device amounted to a civil trespass. in addition it was a serious invasion of privacy in circumstances in which those concerned would have expected their conversations to be private. 62.  i was invited to take into account, and i do, that the installation of the device may well amount to an invasion of the general right to privacy under article 8 [of the convention]. it is not for me to determine whether there has, in fact, been a breach of article 8, but in weighing this point i must bear in mind that it is at least arguable that the interference in the present case could be justified on one or more of the grounds set out in article 8 \u00a7 2. in those circumstances i cannot see any reason for concluding that the possible breach of article 8 was either substantial or significant. 63.  i was also invited to consider whether the admission of this evidence and the difficulties faced by the defence in seeking to test the validity of the chief constable\u2019s decision breached article 6 of the convention ... i am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that to the extent that there has been a breach of article 6 it has not in fact deprived these defendants of the right to a fair trial.\u201d 21.  the applicants also challenged the admissibility of evidence derived from the use of covert listening devices attached to the officers charging them and dealing with their antecedents. judge brodrick stated:\n\u201c75.  ... it does not seem to me to be right to attach great weight to the unfair way in which the control tapes were obtained. the fact that they provide relevant evidence, in the sense that they are a reliable sample of speech, which can be clearly attributed to each of these defendants, weighs more heavily in my judgment. on balance therefore i am satisfied that the admission of the control tapes would not have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that i ought to exclude them.\u201d 22.  the police submitted statements from those officers who had conducted the audio and visual surveillance of the flat, and the searches of the flat and the recovered vehicles. there was also evidence from officers who had been keeping watch on a cache. one officer stated that the item hidden under a tree was in fact a revolver. the first applicant was seen collecting this item on the evening of 15 march 1995. 23.  on 9 august 1996 the applicants were convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and were sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. they applied to the court of appeal for leave to appeal on grounds relating to the judge\u2019s rulings to admit taped evidence. they did not challenge the judge\u2019s decisions with respect to non-disclosure of certain evidence on public interest immunity grounds. their applications were refused on 12 november 1996, a single judge finding that the judge\u2019s exercise of his discretion to admit evidence did not give rise to an arguable ground of appeal. notification of the refusal was sent to them on 10 and 20 december 1996 respectively. it does not appear that the applicants made any complaints to the

{"text": "8.  on 14 february 1992 the pension fund of the applicant\u2019s employer granted the applicant a full temporary disability pension as from 1 march 1992 until 30 june 1992. thereafter the period of full pension was prolonged several times. 9.  on 13 june 1997 the pension fund reviewed its previous decision and changed the applicant\u2019s pension into a partial one for an indefinite period beginning on 1 june 1997. the pension fund reasoned its decision by observing that, according to the documents submitted to the pension fund, the applicant\u2019s capability to work could no longer be considered reduced to such an extent as entitling him to a full disability pension. it was also noted that the applicant could be expected to work at least part-time. 10.  the applicant appealed to the pension board, which on 4 march 1998 rejected the appeal. the decision was reasoned as follows:\n\u201can employee is entitled to a full disability pension provided that his or her ability to work has continuously been reduced by at least three fifths for a minimum of one year and that this reduction has been caused by an illness, a defect or an injury. the employee\u2019s remaining ability to earn income by carrying out work that would be available to him or her and that he or she could reasonably be expected to perform must be taken into account when assessing the reduction in the employee\u2019s ability to work. furthermore, the employee\u2019s education, previous activities, age, living conditions and other comparable factors must be taken into consideration.\naccording to the statements on [the applicant\u2019s] state of health, [the applicant] suffers from depression that has become more difficult during the autumn of 1997. however, [the applicant\u2019s] symptoms must be considered as mild. therefore, the pension board finds [the applicant] still partly capable of working as from 1 june 1997.\u201d 11.  the applicant appealed to the insurance court. he referred, inter alia, to several medical statements according to which he was for the time being incapable of working because of his mental illness. on 27 october 1998, the insurance court rejected the appeal reasoning the decision as follows:\n\u201c[the insurance court refers to] the reasons given in the pension board\u2019s decision. the new material filed while the case was pending [before the insurance court] does not change the evaluation of [the applicant\u2019s] disability.\u201d 12.  the pension fund decided later, on 27 january 1999, to reject the applicant\u2019s renewed application for a full disability pension instead of partial one. the pension board rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal on 25 may 1999. the applicant further appealed to the insurance court which, on 22 june 2000, found that the applicant\u2019s capability of working had been reduced at least by 60 percent on account of his illness as from the beginning of december 1999, and ordered the pension fund to grant the applicant a full disability pension as from 1 january 1999.", "labels": ["6"]}
{"text": "10.  in the course of a judicial investigation concerning the applicant, his wife, his former brother-in-law and one of his nephews, the applicant was remanded in custody on 16 june 1993 and charged with rape of a child under 15 (his niece), sexual assaults on children under 15 (his nephews) and a number of further counts of sexual assault.\non 16 september 1993 the investigating judge at the lorient tribunal de grande instance ordered medico-psychological examinations of the applicant\u2019s niece and all the persons under investigation. he appointed two doctors, named gautier and daumer, for that purpose. 11.  the two doctors were informed of the applicant\u2019s criminal record. in addition to a number of prison sentences, this included an investigation opened in 1989 into charges against the applicant of sexual interference with the daughter of his brother-in-law\u2019s sister. 12.  on 29 october 1993 the experts filed their report on the applicant. they stated, among other things, that although the applicant, by his own admission, did have fantasist and even mythomaniac tendencies, these were not obviously pathological in nature, as had been shown two years previously by his statements regarding the relations between p.h. and k.s, two of the victims. 13.  the doctors concluded as follows:\n\u201c1.  our examination of g.b. has revealed psychopathic traits and signs of sexual perversion for which objective evidence is provided by his statements regarding p.h. and c.h. 2.  the offence of which he stands accused with respect to c.h. and p.h. is linked to a state of sexual perversion. it is difficult to assess the extent or the nature of this state in so far as the accused presents the facts as isolated incidents. he denies raping k.s. and so it is not possible to address that issue from a clinical viewpoint. 5.  rehabilitation will not pose a problem, but a cure will depend on clearer identification of the subject\u2019s underlying sexual problem. 6.  the subject was not insane within the meaning of (former) article 64 of the criminal code when committing the offences of which he stands accused. 14.  in november 1993 the experts\u2019 conclusions were served on the applicant. the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial was extended several times during the investigation of the case. 15.  on 19 october 1995 the applicant and his co-defendants (j.c.h., c.h. and s.c., the applicant\u2019s wife) were committed for trial at the morbihan assize court by a judgment delivered by the indictment division of the rennes court of appeal. the indictment division pointed out, in particular, that the applicant had initially denied any sexual abuse of his niece and nephews and then admitted to the conduct of which he was accused only to retract that admission. it related what had been said during the examination of the applicant\u2019s niece on the one hand and his nephews on the other, the latter having also been accused of rape and sexual abuse by the niece. the indictment division also mentioned the previous convictions on the applicant\u2019s criminal record, namely driving under the influence of alcohol, insulting a member of the police force in the performance of his duties, a hit-and-run offence and a further conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol. 16.  the applicant appealed on points of law against the decision to commit him for trial, drawing attention to the vagueness of the terms used in the operative provisions of that decision. in a judgment of 26 february 1996 the court of cassation rejected that appeal. 17.  the trial at the assize court began on 13 march 1997. the registrar read out the decision of the indictment division committing the applicant for trial. at that point the advocate-general stated that he wished to file certain documents regarding the personality of the defendants, including the applicant, and relating primarily to offences reported in 1979 and 1980. 18.  the documents in question were records of evidence taken from witnesses, a procedural report by a police superintendent, a psychiatric report on the applicant at the age of 17 and a judgment relating to educational assistance. they comprised mainly a description of the applicant\u2019s sexual conduct when he was a minor and information about his family background. they related firstly to a charge of indecent assault on a girl under 15 brought against him in 1979 in proceedings during which the applicant had said that he had done the same thing \u201cat least a dozen times both with little girls and with little boys aged between 7 and 9\u201d and, secondly, to several counts of indecent assault without violence on three children under the age of 15. the proceedings concerning these offences, brought in 1979, and those mentioned above were discontinued. 19.  the applicant\u2019s lawyer objected to the filing of those documents and requested an adjournment to prepare a pleading to that effect. the hearing was adjourned for thirty-five minutes. the applicant\u2019s lawyer lodged an application for all the documents to be rejected on the ground that they related to offences that were subject to limitation and had occurred prior to various amnesty laws which could apply to them. according to the defence, the documents were so old that they contravened the principle that a defendant\u2019s antecedents were inadmissible in evidence against him. 20.  in an interlocutory judgment delivered on the same day the assize court rejected that application on the following grounds:\n\u201c... the prosecution, like every other party to a criminal trial, is entitled to produce at the hearing any documents that appear to be helpful in establishing the truth provided that they relate to the offences of which the defendants stand accused and shed light on their personality.\nprovided that they are communicated to all the parties and can thus be examined adversarially, the production of such documents cannot have any adverse effect on the rights of the defence. ...\u201d 21.  copies of the documents filed by the prosecution were distributed to each of the civil parties\u2019 lawyers and the defence lawyers but the case was not adjourned. 22.  when the examination of the defendants began as to their backgrounds, the applicant\u2019s hearing was deliberately put back until the end of the afternoon. exercising his discretionary powers, the president of the assize court called a teacher of children with special needs as a witness to be heard for information purposes only. following that hearing, the respective lawyers of c.h., who stood accused along with the applicant, and of p.h. declared that they were bringing civil-party proceedings on their clients\u2019 behalf and made a written application.\nthe trial was adjourned. 23.  at the beginning of the afternoon the lawyer representing the applicant\u2019s wife in turn applied for the investigation to be reopened to take account of the documents relating to her that had been filed by the prosecution. those documents included a judgment delivered by the lorient tribunal de grande instance in 1996, records of the hearing by that court\u2019s registrar and written statements by s.c. the applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s lawyer requested that in the course of the reopened investigation the statements on the proceedings made by mr and mrs b. in the documents filed by the prosecution be added to the file. failing that, the trial would have to be adjourned to a subsequent session. in support of his requests, the lawyer relied on the requirement of a fair trial. 24.  in an interlocutory judgment the assize court deferred its decision on the above application pending completion of the hearing of evidence. the president continued his examination of the defendants until 6 p.m. with one short adjournment of fifteen minutes. at 6.20 p.m. the examination of the defendants resumed and thereafter a witness was heard. 25.  lastly, on the evening of the first day of the trial, that is on 13 march 1997, the court heard one of the experts who had been appointed to prepare an opinion during the pre-trial investigation. he made an oral presentation of the report he had submitted on 29 october 1993 during the investigation proceedings (see paragraph 13 above). 26.  the president then adjourned the proceedings for fifteen minutes during which the expert studied the new documents produced by the prosecution. 27.  as soon as the hearing of the expert resumed, the latter allegedly changed his opinion, stating, among other things, that the applicant was a \u201cpaedophile\u201d and that \u201cpsychotherapy [was] necessary, but would be ineffective for the time being\u201d. 28.  the examination of the expert lasted about two hours, at the end of which the president authorised him to withdraw permanently, a decision on which he had consulted the parties and to which none of them had raised any objection. 29.  on the following day, 14 march 1997, the applicant\u2019s lawyer disputed the expert\u2019s oral submissions and applied for a second opinion, on the following grounds:\n\u201cafter ... one of the two experts appointed by the investigating judge had made his statement before the assize court, he was informed of the two discontinued sets of proceedings that had been brought against g.b., who is now 34, when he was 16 years old. the depositions made by g.b. at that time were read out to the expert. immediately after being informed of those facts, of which he had been unaware when preparing his expert opinion, the expert radically altered his submissions, stating that:\n\u2013  in his view g.b. is unquestionably a paedophile;\n\u2013  psychotherapeutic treatment is necessary, but, given g.b.\u2019s current state of mind, would be totally ineffective because he has no feelings of guilt;\n\u2013  the length of a prison sentence has no effect on an individual of that type as the potential to be cured depends solely on a feeling of guilt, which g.b. lacks;\n\u2013  in the absence of a feeling of guilt, there is a major risk that g.b. will reoffend even after a long sentence, meaning that imprisonment can only serve as a means of protecting society. ... g.b. formally disputes the expert\u2019s oral submissions. a second opinion is indispensable. if it had considered it necessary, it was during the investigation that the prosecution should have filed the documents it produced at the beginning of the trial relating to proceedings brought over fifteen years ago. in that case the expert would have drawn up his report in the light of the evidence contained therein and g.b. would undoubtedly have requested a second opinion, prepared by two experts.\nthe assize court therefore heard an oral report that differed radically from the written report by the two experts.\nrespect for the rights of the defence requires that a new expert opinion be ordered in the context of an application for the investigation to be reopened. everyone has the right to a fair trial.\u201d 30.  the lawyer also applied for the applicant\u2019s release on the ground that his client should not have to suffer the consequences of the prosecution\u2019s having taken three years and nine months to file documents that it considered indispensable. 31.  in an interlocutory judgment of 14 march the assize court deferred its decision on the application for further investigative measures pending completion of the hearing of evidence and rejected the application for release on the ground that detention was \u201cnecessary to ensure that the defendant remain[ed] at the disposal of the judicial authorities\u201d. 32.  the president continued to examine the defendants and obtained their statements. after that he took evidence from the applicant\u2019s mother, from a person sentenced for a serious crime and from eight witnesses. 33.  the applicant\u2019s lawyer then reiterated his previous submissions while his wife\u2019s lawyer withdrew the interlocutory application he had lodged with the assize court. 34.  on 15 march 1997 the assize court took formal note of the withdrawal by s.c.\u2019s lawyer. on 15 march 1997, after a procedural defect vitiating the interlocutory application made by the applicant\u2019s lawyer had in the meantime been cured, the assize court nevertheless refused it. it made the following points regarding the complaint of an infringement of the rights of the defence:\n\u201cfirstly, the new documents produced by the prosecution and duly communicated to each of the parties to the proceedings could have been contested, particularly by g.b., whether directly or through the intermediary of his counsel.\nsecondly, once the above documents had been brought to the notice of the expert ... and he had completed the presentation of his report, g.b. and his counsel were in a position to request any further information or explanations from him that they required.\nthus it cannot legitimately be argued that the production of new documents and their consideration by the psychiatric expert were capable of infringing the rights of the defence.\nat all events, in view of the outcome of the oral examination at the hearing, it does not seem essential for the establishment of the truth to seek a second psychiatric opinion.\nconsequently, there is no cause for the proceedings to be adjourned ...\u201d 35.  the assize court also rejected the applicant\u2019s application for release. 36.  on 15 march 1997 the assize court sentenced the applicant to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment for a number of counts of raping his niece, a child under 15, sexually assaulting a girl under 15 and sexually assaulting his nephews. the sentences imposed on the three other co-defendants were less severe (ten years\u2019 imprisonment, a fully suspended five-year prison sentence with probation, and a five-year prison sentence, one year of which was suspended with probation). 37.  the applicant appealed on points of law. in his first ground of appeal he argued that the assize court\u2019s consenting to file the documents produced by the prosecution amounted to a violation of his right to a fair trial, particularly the principle of equality of arms, since his lawyer had only had half a day to study the documents in issue whereas the prosecution had had them for some time. relying also on article 6 of the convention, the applicant submitted another plea regarding the assize court\u2019s refusal to order a second opinion. he argued that the examination by the expert of the new documents that had been produced at the hearing, which had made him radically change his initial submissions, required an effective second opinion for the sentence imposed to satisfy the legal requirement that it must be suited to the personality of the defendant. 38.  in a judgment of 11 february 1998 the criminal division of the court of cassation rejected the appeal in its entirety. regarding the grounds of appeal based on an infringement of the right to a fair trial, the court of cassation stated as follows:\n\u201cwhen, after the decision committing the defendant for trial had been read out, the advocate-general produced various documents including the records of a number of discontinued proceedings relating to the defendant, the defence objected and requested that those documents should not be filed.\nas justification for its rejection of that request, the assize court stated that the prosecution, like every other party to criminal proceedings, is entitled to produce at the trial any documents that appear to afford assistance in establishing the truth in so far as they relate to the offences of which the defendants stand accused and shed light on their personality. if they have been communicated to all the parties so that there has been an opportunity for adversarial argument about them, the production of such documents cannot legitimately be said to have any adverse effect on the rights of the defence.\nin ruling to that effect, the assize court provided a legal basis for its decision without laying itself open to the objection raised in the ground of appeal because, the adversarial principle having been respected, no statutory or treaty provision prevented documents relating to offences subject to limitation but not covered by an amnesty being filed in that way. ...\nas justification for its refusal to order the second expert opinion sought by the defence, the court, having deferred its decision on the examination of that application, held, after taking evidence, that the requested measure was not indispensable for the establishment of the truth.\nin ruling to that effect, the assize court, which was not obliged to respond to mere arguments in submissions, determined a matter over which it alone had jurisdiction, deciding that there was no reason to allow the application.\u201d", "labels": ["6"]}
{"text": "9.  the united macedonian organisation ilinden (\u201cthe applicant association\u201d or \u201cilinden\u201d) is an association based in south-western bulgaria (in an area known as the pirin region or the geographic region of pirin macedonia).\nmr boris stankov is a bulgarian citizen, born in 1926 and living in petrich. at the relevant time he was the chairman of a branch of the applicant association. 10.  the united macedonian organisation ilinden was founded on 14 april 1990. its aims, according to its statute and programme, were to \u201cunite all macedonians in bulgaria on a regional and cultural basis\u201d and to achieve \u201cthe recognition of the macedonian minority in bulgaria\u201d. sections 8 and 9 of the statute stated that the organisation would not infringe the territorial integrity of bulgaria and that it \u201cwould not use violent, brutal, inhuman or unlawful means\u201d.\naccording to the applicants\u2019 submissions before the court, the main activity of the applicant association was the organisation of celebrations to commemorate historical events of importance for macedonians in bulgaria. over an unspecified period it published a newspaper. 11.  in 1990 ilinden applied for, but was refused, registration. in the proceedings for registration the blagoevgrad regional court and the supreme court examined the statute of the association, its programme and other written evidence. 12.  in their decisions of july and november 1990 and march 1991 the courts found that the applicant association\u2019s aims were directed against the unity of the nation, that it advocated national and ethnic hatred, and that it was dangerous for the territorial integrity of bulgaria. therefore, its registration would be contrary to articles 3, 8 and 52 \u00a7 3 of the constitution of 1971, as in force at the time. in particular, the aims of the association included, inter alia, the \u201cpolitical development of macedonia\u201d and the establishment of a \u201cunited, independent macedonian state\u201d. moreover, in its appeal to the supreme court the association had stated that \u201cthe macedonian people would not accept bulgarian, greek or serbian rule\u201d. the formal declaration in the applicant association\u2019s statute that it would not infringe the territorial integrity of bulgaria, appeared inconsistent with the remaining material. 13.  the judgment of the supreme court of 11 march 1991 stated, inter alia:\n\u201c[t]he lower courts correctly established that the aims of the [applicant association] under its statute and programme were directed against the unity of the nation ... [the material in the case] demonstrates that the [applicant association] seeks to disseminate the ideas of macedonianism among the bulgarian population, especially in a particular geographical area. [those ideas] presuppose the \u2018denationalisation\u2019 of the bulgarian population and its conversion into a macedonian population ... it follows that the [applicant association] is directed against the unity of the nation and is therefore prohibited under article 35 \u00a7 3 of the [1971] constitution ...\u201d 14.  the parties do not dispute, it seems, that during the relevant period the applicant association underwent changes of leadership and that there was internal conflict. its local branches or separate factions differed in their views and activities. 15.  the applicant association held a meeting for the first time on 22 april 1990 at the rozhen monastery, at the grave of yane sandanski. 16.  on 20 april 1991 the applicant association organised a commemoration meeting at the rozhen monastery. the participants adopted a declaration addressed to the president and parliament, which stated, inter alia:\n\u201c1.  our rights as a minority, of which we have been deprived, should be guaranteed to us in accordance with the international agreements on minorities.\n[we demand:] 2.  the introduction of the [study of] the macedonian language, history and culture in all educational institutions in pirin macedonia. 8.  that all bulgarian political parties on the territory of pirin macedonia should be dissolved or renamed macedonian; they should defend the national rights of the macedonian people.\n... 14.  the complete cultural, economic and political autonomy of pirin macedonia and the withdrawal of the bulgarian occupation armies from pirin macedonia ...\n... 16.  should the bulgarian government not respond positively to our demands, ilinden shall appeal to the united nations organisation, the [conference on] security and cooperation in europe, the european parliament, the great powers, in the interest of peace in the balkans and in europe and with a view to avoiding military conflicts due to the emerging nationalism in bulgaria, serbia, greece and albania, with the following demands: annulment of the separatist military union of 20 february 1912 between bulgaria, serbia and greece, withdrawal of the invaders from the occupied territories, ... unification of macedonia under the auspices of the united nations and with the protection of the great powers ...\u201d 17.  according to a police report, drawn up in 1998 by the director of the police in the region and submitted to the court by the government, \u201cfierce anti-bulgarian declarations\u201d had been made at the meetings of 22 april 1990 and 20 april 1991. in particular, on 22 april 1990 a declaration requesting the recognition of a macedonian minority and cultural autonomy had been read out. the report did not mention any incident at that meeting.\nas explained in the report, on 20 april 1991 about 300 to 350 ilinden supporters had gathered during the official commemoration of the death of yane sandanski, which had been attended by 4,000 participants. members of ilinden, standing on a separate platform, had allegedly hissed and booed the police, labelled the bulgarians \u201cbarbarians\u201d, \u201cconquerors\u201d and \u201censlavers\u201d and called on them to leave and \u201cfree\u201d the region from their presence. the report further stated that a \u201cshocking\u201d incident had occurred: mr b., a prominent politician, had been splashed with beer on his face. the police had allegedly prevented any further clashes.\nthe report concluded:\n\u201c... the events organised by ilinden are provocative. there is a real risk of incidents. for that reason, since 1992 the municipalities in the region normally refuse to allow such events to proceed. with a view to protecting the law, the assistance of the prosecuting authorities and of the police is normally sought.\u201d 18.  the applicants submitted copies of photographs, written testimonies and statements of persons who claimed that on several occasions between 1990 and 1994 there had been police actions and acts of private individuals obstructing the activities of the applicant association.\nthey also submitted copies of newspaper articles accusing ilinden of misappropriating bulgarian national symbols, describing its leaders as uneducated, mentally ill or traitors, and denying the existence of a macedonian minority in bulgaria. the applicants alleged that those articles reflected public opinion in bulgaria, as manipulated by the authorities. 19.  in july 1994 mr stankov, as chairman of the petrich branch of the applicant association, requested the mayor of petrich to authorise a meeting in the area of samuilova krepost, to be held on 31 july 1994 in commemoration of a historical event. on 13 july 1994 permission was refused by the mayor, but no reasons were given. the applicant association appealed to the petrich district court which dismissed the appeal on 16 july 1994. the district court found that since the applicant association had been banned, there were well-founded fears that the demonstration would endanger public order and the rights and freedoms of others.\non 28 july 1994 mr ivanov, the representative of the applicant association, and another person were issued with written warnings by the police to stay away from the official traditional fair at samuilova krepost. the warnings stated that they were based on the applicable law. 20.  despite the refusal of the authorities, on 31 july 1994 some members of the applicant association (120-150 according to the applicants\u2019 assessment) attempted to approach the historical site of samuilova krepost but the police, who according to the applicants were heavily armed, blocked their way.\nin the government\u2019s submission, the allegation that the area had been sealed off was \u201cmanifestly ill-founded\u201d. 21.  on 10 april 1995 the applicant association requested the mayor of sandanski to authorise a meeting to be held on 22 april 1995 at the grave of yane sandanski at the rozhen monastery, on the occasion of the eightieth anniversary of his death.\nthis was refused on 14 april 1995 as the applicant association was not duly registered by the courts. on 15 april 1995 the applicant association appealed to the sandanski district court stating, inter alia, that the macedonian people had been deprived of their right to their own cultural life in violation of international law. the district court never examined the appeal. 22.  on 22 april 1995 the municipality of sandanski held an official ceremony to mark the anniversary of yane sandanski\u2019s death. the event took place at his grave at the rozhen monastery. the ceremony commenced at about 10 a.m.\nthe applicants submitted that a group of their supporters who had travelled to the rozhen monastery on 22 april 1995 had been ordered by the police to leave their cars in the nearby town of melnik and had been transported to the monastery by local buses. there they had been allowed to visit the grave, to lay a wreath and to light candles. however, they had not been allowed to bring to the site the placards, banners and musical instruments which they were carrying, or to make speeches at the grave. the police had allegedly taken away the ribbon attached to the wreath. the participants had then celebrated the event, without music, near the monastery but away from the grave. 23.  in july 1995, as in previous years, the applicant association again requested authorisation to hold a commemorative meeting on 30 july 1995 at samuilova krepost, the historical site in the vicinity of petrich. on 14 july 1995 the mayor of petrich refused the request without giving any reason. upon the applicant association\u2019s appeal the refusal was upheld by judgment of the petrich district court of 18 july 1995. the district court found that the \u201cholding of a commemorative meeting of ilinden on 30 july 1995 at samuilova krepost would endanger public order\u201d. 24.  on 8 april 1997 the applicant association informed the mayor of sandanski and the local police that they were organising a meeting to be held on 20 april 1997 at the rozhen monastery to commemorate the death of yane sandanski. it stated in a letter to the mayor that yane sandanski, who is considered in bulgaria as a bulgarian national hero, was in fact a \u201cmacedonian fighter for the national independence of macedonia from turkish rule and against the bulgarian oppressors\u201d.\non 11 april 1997 the mayor refused to grant permission. he stated that permission for the commemoration of the same historical event had been requested on 4 april 1997 by the director of the local high school. the mayor further explained that the commemoration would be organised jointly by the school and the municipality and that \u201cevery [person], individually, could come\u201d. 25.  on 15 april 1997 ilinden appealed to the sandanski district court against the mayor\u2019s refusal stating, inter alia, that the mayor had not allowed them, \u201cas a separate ethnic community\u201d, to organise a meeting at the tomb of their national hero.\non 17 april 1997 the president of the district court issued an order refusing to examine the appeal on the merits as it had been submitted on behalf of an unregistered organisation. 26.  the date on which that order was notified to the applicant association is unclear. the applicants initially denied having received a response to their appeal, but in later submissions to the commission stated that on 5 may 1997 they had become aware of the order of 17 april 1997. 27.  as the defects in the appeal were not remedied within the statutory seven-day time-limit, on 5 may 1997 the president of the district court ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings. that order was notified to the applicant association on 13 august 1997. 28.  the applicants claimed that on 20 april 1997 the police had prevented a group of their supporters from approaching the rozhen monastery and that two persons had been ill-treated. they submitted that on 20 april 1997 only thirteen students and two teachers from the local high school had arrived at the rozhen monastery. the students had laid a wreath in the presence of the police and had left two minutes later. 29.  on 14 july 1997 mr stankov, as chairman of the association\u2019s branch in petrich, requested authorisation for a commemorative meeting to be held on 2 august 1997 at samuilova krepost, in the outskirts of petrich. on 17 july 1997 the mayor refused the request, stating that the applicant association was not \u201ca legitimate organisation\u201d. 30.  on 20 july 1997 the applicant association appealed to the district court against the refusal of the mayor stating, inter alia, that there was no legal provision prohibiting meetings of organisations which were not \u201clegitimate\u201d and that the planned public event would be peaceful and would not endanger public order.\nby decision of 1 august 1997 the district court dismissed the appeal on the merits. it found that the applicant association was not duly registered \u201cin accordance with the laws of the country\u201d and that it had not been shown that the persons who had acted on its behalf actually represented it. as a result, it had been unclear who had organised the event and who would be responsible for order during the meeting under the terms of sections 9 and 10 of the meetings and marches act. the district court concluded that the lack of clarity as regards the organisers of a public event endangered public order and the rights and freedoms of others. 31.  the applicants submitted that on 2 august 1997 the police had not allowed a group of supporters of the applicant association to reach the historical site in the vicinity of petrich. 32.  the parties made submissions and presented copies of documents concerning the activities of the applicant association.\nit appears that some of the documents relied upon by the government concern statements of persons adhering to a faction or a branch of the applicant association. those groups apparently differed in their views and activities. 33.  the government relied on the declaration of 20 april 1991 (see paragraph 16 above), on the police report concerning the meetings of 1990 and 1991 (see paragraph 17 above) and on other material.\nthe government submitted that during meetings, in letters to institutions or in statements to the media, persons associated with the applicant association and its supporters had made declarations to the effect that they wanted the bulgarians to leave the region of pirin macedonia and stated that there could be \u201cno peace in the balkans unless the bulgarians, the greeks and all others recognise the national rights of the macedonian people and no democracy in any balkan country without such recognition\u201d. 34.  the government submitted copies of several issues of vestnik za makedonzite v balgaria i po sveta and makedonska poshta, pamphlets published by one of the factions linked to the applicant association, and copies of press material. these contain information, inter alia, about a \u201csecret\u201d private meeting of a faction of the applicant association held on 28 september 1997. the meeting allegedly declared that on 10 august 1998 the region of pirin macedonia would become \u201cpolitically, economically and culturally autonomous\u201d or independent. that was so because on that day, eighty-five years after the bucharest treaty of 1913, the states parties to it were allegedly under obligation to withdraw from the \u201censlaved\u201d macedonian territories.\nmakedonska poshta further invited all macedonians to a march in sofia on 3 august 1998. the invitation stressed that the participants should not carry arms. 35.  a handwritten poster, allegedly issued by followers of the applicant association in petrich, called for a boycott of the 1994 parliamentary election \u201cto prevent the establishment of legitimate bulgarian authorities in the region\u201d of pirin macedonia. the document further called for a united macedonian state and for \u201can international invasion\u201d by the security council of the united nations \u201caccording to the model of grenada, kuwait and haiti\u201d. 36.  an appeal for a boycott of the 1997 election stated that the macedonians should abstain from voting in protest against the lack of recognition of their rights as a minority. 37.  in a declaration published in the press in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, the leaders of a faction linked to the applicant association criticised the bulgarian authorities for their refusal to recognise the macedonian language and the macedonian minority in bulgaria and appealed to various international organisations to exert pressure on the bulgarian authorities in this respect. 38.  the government submitted a copy of a \u201cmemorandum\u201d addressed to the united nations, signed by activists of the applicant association or a faction of it, dated 1 july 1997. it contains a short overview of historical events, complaints about the attitude of the bulgarian authorities and the following main demands: collective minority rights, access to bulgarian state archives, the return of confiscated material, the revision of the way bulgarian history is seen, the revision of international treaties of 1912 and 1913, the dissolution of the \u201cpolitical police\u201d, the dissolution of nationalistic and violent parties and organisations, the registration of ilinden as the legitimate organisation of the macedonians in bulgaria, radio broadcasts in macedonian, an investigation into violations committed against macedonians and economic assistance.\nthe document also stated:\n\u201c... being conscious of the contemporary economic and political realities in the balkans, europe and the world, we are not acting through confrontation, tension or violence. our way to achieve enjoyment of our rights as a macedonian ethnic minority in bulgaria and in pirin macedonia, where our ethnic and historical roots lie, is through peaceful means and negotiations ...\nour peaceful and lawful means ... are to the advantage of the authorities who ... deny the existence of a macedonian minority. our democratic ways are to our detriment: the authorities can afford political, economic and psychological pressure, and arms.\u201d 39.  before the court the government relied on a judgment of the bulgarian constitutional court of 29 february 2000 in a case concerning the constitutionality of a political party, the united macedonian organisation ilinden-pirin: party for economic development and integration of the population (\u201cumoipirin\u201d), which had been registered by the competent courts in 1999. the constitutional court found that that party\u2019s aims were directed against the territorial integrity of the country and that therefore it was unconstitutional. 40.  the constitutional court noted that umoipirin could be regarded as a successor to or a continuation of the applicant association. on that basis the constitutional court relied extensively on submissions about the history and the activities of the applicant association in the assessment of the question whether umoipirin was constitutional.\nin particular, the constitutional court took note of the demands made in the declaration of the applicant association of 20 april 1991 (see paragraph 16 above). it also observed that maps of the region, depicting parts of bulgarian and greek territory as macedonian, had been published by the association and that there had been repeated calls for autonomy and even secession. the constitutional court further noted that representatives of the applicant association had made offensive remarks about the bulgarian nation. 41.  the constitutional court thus found that the applicant association and umoipirin considered the region of pirin as a territory which was only temporarily under bulgarian control and would soon become independent. their activities were therefore directed against the territorial integrity of the country and were as such prohibited under article 44 \u00a7 2 of the 1991 constitution. the prohibition was in conformity with article 11 \u00a7 2 of the convention, there being no doubt that an activity against the territorial integrity of the country endangered its national security.\nthe judgment was adopted by nine votes to three. the dissenting judges gave separate opinions which have not been published. 42.  in support of this allegation the government have submitted copies of two documents. 43.  the first is a copy of an article from the kontinent daily newspaper, dated 1/2 march 1997. the newspaper stated that a mr d.p.k. had been arrested in petrich for having threatened police officers with blowing up their homes, as they had impeded his business. during the arrest the police had allegedly discovered explosives in mr d.p.k.\u2019s home. the short article went on to recall that mr d.p.k. was allegedly a leader of ilinden and a \u201cmacedonian activist\u201d. 44.  the second document appears to be a photocopy of a flyer announcing the founding of an organisation and inviting those interested to join. the document bears no signature. it dates allegedly from 1995 and appears to have been typed on a typewriter.\nthe flyer explained that the newly created united macedonian organisation nova did not wish to replace ilinden. it criticised certain leaders of the applicant association.\nthe flyer further stated that the new organisation would form armed groups with the aim of \u201chelping the republic of macedonia to survive\u201d. 45.  the government have not provided any comment or additional information on the contents of the two documents submitted by them. 46.  during the hearing before the court, in response to a question put to her, the government\u2019s agent declared that no criminal proceedings relevant to the present case had ever been brought against members of the applicant association. 47.  the government stressed that knowledge of the historical context and of the current situation in bulgaria and in the balkans was essential for the understanding of the issues in the present case. their explanation may be summarised as follows.\n\u201chistorically, the bulgarian nation consolidated within several geographical regions, one of them being the geographical region of macedonia. in 1878, when bulgaria was partially liberated from turkish dominance, the berlin peace treaty left the region of macedonia within the borders of turkey. between 1878 and 1913 the bulgarian population of macedonia organised five unsuccessful uprisings seeking liberation from turkish rule and union with bulgaria. there followed massive refugee migrations from the region to the bulgarian motherland. hundreds of thousands of macedonian bulgarians settled in bulgaria.\nin 1934 the so-called \u2018macedonian nation\u2019 was proclaimed for the first time by a resolution of the communist international. before that no reliable historical source had ever mentioned any slavic population in the region other than the bulgarian population. after the second world war the communist power in yugoslavia proclaimed the concept of a separate macedonian nation. a separate language and alphabet were created and imposed by decree of 2 august 1944. a massive assimilation campaign accompanied by brutalities was launched in yugoslavia. for a short period of time the bulgarian communist party \u2013 inspired by the idea of creating a bulgarian-yugoslav federation \u2013 also initiated a campaign of forcible imposition of a \u2018macedonian\u2019 identity on the population in the region of pirin macedonia. in the 1946 and 1956 censuses individuals living in that region were forced to declare themselves \u2018macedonians\u2019. the campaign was abandoned in 1963, partly due to the refusal of the population to change their identity.\nin those parts of the geographical region of macedonia which were in yugoslavia the realities of the bi-polar cold-war world \u2013 where the relations between yugoslavia and the socialist block dominated by the ussr were tense \u2013 exacerbated the population\u2019s feeling of doom and exasperation and their fear that unification with bulgaria proper would never be possible. the forcible imposition of a macedonian identity by the tito regime also played a decisive role.\ntherefore, even if a process of formation of a new nation has taken place, it was limited to the territory of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia.\nin the 1992 census, only 3,019 bulgarian citizens identified themselves as macedonians and indicated macedonian as their mother tongue. another 7,784 declared themselves macedonians in the geographical sense, while allegedly indicating their bulgarian national conscience and mother tongue.\nindividuals considering themselves macedonians are far from being discriminated against in bulgaria. they have their own cultural and educational organisation, svetlina. there are books and newspapers in the \u2018macedonian language\u2019.\u201d", "labels": ["11"]}
{"text": "7.  on 1 october 1993 the pozna\u0144-nowe miasto district prosecutor (prokurator rejonowy), on the basis of evidence obtained by the warsaw police headquarters (komenda sto\u0142eczna policji) from the interpol office in london, opened an investigation against persons unknown into the circumstances of an attempt to obtain a loan of 25,000,000 us dollars (usd) by false pretences. on 5 november 1993 the prosecutor laid charges against two persons of having attempted to forge bank guarantees and fraudulently to seize public property. 8.  a day later, on 6 november 1993, the pozna\u0144-nowe miasto district prosecutor charged the applicant with forgery and attempting to obtain a loan of usd 25,000,000 by false pretences, committed together with four other persons, and detained him on remand on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged. 9.  subsequently, on 8 november 1993, the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor (prokurator wojew\u00f3dzki) took over the investigation from the pozna\u0144-nowe miasto district prosecutor. 10.  on 10 and 15 november 1993 respectively, both the applicant and his defence counsel appealed against the detention order of 6 november 1993. the other suspects lodged similar appeals at about the same time. on 13 december 1993 the pozna\u0144 regional court (s\u0105d wojew\u00f3dzki) upheld all the detention orders. 11.  on 10 and 14 january 1994 the investigating prosecutor ordered that evidence be obtained from an expert in graphology, an expert in financial and banking matters, as well as from a psychiatrist and a psychologist. on 12 january 1994 the prosecutor issued a letter of request to the german authorities, asking them to hear evidence from certain witnesses residing in germany. 12.  on 12 january 1994, at the applicant\u2019s request, the regional prosecutor presented, in writing, detailed reasons for the charges laid against him. the prosecutor maintained, in particular, that those charges were based on abundant evidence, in particular in the form of bank documents and testimonies of the applicant\u2019s co-suspects. in consequence and in the light of the material collected at this stage, the prosecution considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant and his co-suspects had forged thirty provisional bank guarantees and fifty final bank guarantees in order to obtain a loan of usd 25,000,000. 13.  on 20 january 1994 the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor ordered that the charges laid against the applicant in other criminal proceedings instituted against him by the inowroc\u0142aw district prosecutor be joined in the same criminal proceedings and, accordingly, referred the latter case to the investigating prosecutor. 14.  on 31 january 1994, on an application by the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor, the pozna\u0144 regional court prolonged the applicant\u2019s and his co-suspects\u2019 detention until 4 may 1994. on 15 march 1994, ruling on the applicant\u2019s appeal, the pozna\u0144 court of appeal (s\u0105d apelacyjny) upheld the first-instance decision. 15.  in the meantime, on 14 march 1994, the applicant had asked the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor to release him or to vary the measure imposed on him by replacing detention by bail or police supervision. that application was rejected on 30 march 1994. 16.  on 4 april 1994 the applicant asked the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor to release him on bail. he asserted that his detention was putting a severe strain on his family. in particular, his minor daughter had recently been examined by psychiatrists and it had been found that the separation from her father had seriously affected her mental state. he also submitted that his daughter was suffering from dyslexia and that her mental state had been rapidly worsening during last months. the relevant facts were confirmed by a report made by a psychologist on 5 april 1994. furthermore, the applicant stressed that there was no risk of his absconding and that the proper conduct of the proceedings could be secured by bail. on 22 april 1994 the application was dismissed. 17.  on 25 april 1994, ruling on an application made by the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor, the pozna\u0144 regional court prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 4 july 1994. the applicant and his defence counsel appealed against this decision on 3 and 4 may 1994 respectively. the pozna\u0144 court of appeal dismissed their appeals on an unknown date. 18.  on 15 may 1994 the applicant lodged a further application for release with the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor. it was dismissed on 24 may 1994. the relevant decision was upheld on appeal on 15 june 1994. 19.  on 10 june 1994 the applicant\u2019s defence counsel applied to the regional prosecutor to have the applicant released in view of the fact that his wife was ill and was to be admitted to hospital. he submitted a medical certificate. on 16 june the prosecutor ordered that evidence be obtained from a medical expert in order to define the nature of the wife\u2019s illness and to confirm whether her state of health required treatment in hospital. 20.  later, on 21 june and 19 july 1994, the applicant again asked the prosecutor to release him on bail. he maintained that on account of his long-lasting separation from his family both his daughter and wife were suffering from serious neurosis and depression. 21.  meanwhile, on 27 june 1994, ruling on an application made by the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor on an unknown date in june, the pozna\u0144 regional court had prolonged the applicant\u2019s detention until 31 october 1994. on 11 august 1994 the pozna\u0144 court of appeal, on the applicant\u2019s appeal, upheld that decision in view of the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question and of their serious nature. 22.  on 7 july 1994 the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor had completed the investigation. on 8 july 1994 he lodged a bill of indictment with the pozna\u0144 regional court.  the applicant\u2019s applications for release of 10 and 21 june and of 19 july 1994 were referred to that court together with the case-file. 23.  on 7 september 1994 a medical expert submitted a report stating that the applicant\u2019s wife was suffering from neurasthenia resulting from her family situation. on 19 september 1994 the pozna\u0144 regional court, after considering that report, dismissed all the three above-mentioned applications, holding that the applicant\u2019s detention should continue. the court based its decision on the fact that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the serious nature of those offences. it also found that the applicant\u2019s family situation did not militate against his continuing detention and that there were no grounds on which to release the applicant, as defined in article 218 of the code of criminal procedure. 24.  the applicant appealed on 27 september 1994, submitting, among other things, that the mere suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged could no longer suffice to justify his excessively long detention and that such reasoning showed that the court had breached the principle of the presumption of innocence. he stressed that three of his co-defendants had already been released. 25.  on 13 october 1994 the pozna\u0144 court of appeal dismissed his appeal, holding that the lower court\u2019s findings had not concerned the question of the applicant\u2019s guilt but the likelihood that he had committed the offences in question.  it rejected the applicant\u2019s argument that the three of his co-defendants had been released and stressed that that could not be a factor militating in favour of releasing him. furthermore, the court of appeal considered that the applicant\u2019s detention should continue because of the serious nature of the charges laid against him and the fact that he had acted in an organised group. 26.  on 25 october 1994 the applicant made yet another application for release on bail, submitting that his family situation was critical, especially as the mental state of his wife and daughter had markedly worsened. on 7 november 1994 the court dismissed his application, finding that even though the applicant\u2019s detention was indeed putting a severe strain on his family, the serious nature of the charges laid against him justified his detention. 27.  in the meantime, on 6 november 1994, the applicant attempted to commit suicide by swallowing fifty tablets of the sedative \u201crelanium\u201d[diazepam]. on 6 december 1994 a psychiatrist examined him in prison and found that he was suffering from depression that resulted from his being held in detention and from his prolonged separation from his family. 28.  subsequently, on an unspecified date, the pozna\u0144 regional court scheduled the trial for 7 and 8 december 1994. however, on 5 december 1994 both hearings were cancelled because the presiding judge was ill. 29.  on 12 and 13 december 1994 the applicant and his defence counsel lodged further applications for release, still relying on the difficult situation of the applicant\u2019s family and, in particular, on the fact that the applicant\u2019s minor daughter was in need of treatment in hospital. on 19 december 1994 the pozna\u0144 regional court ordered that evidence from medical experts from the \u0142\u00f3d\u017a medical centre be obtained to determine the child\u2019s condition. the experts submitted their report on 2 february 1995. the court dismissed the application on 6 february 1995. the applicant appealed. the pozna\u0144 court of appeal upheld the first-instance decision on 11 july 1995. 30.  on 21 february 1995 the pozna\u0144 regional court held a hearing but decided not to examine the case on the merits and remitted it to the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor. it ordered that a further investigation be carried out. on 10 march 1995, on the parties\u2019 appeals, the pozna\u0144 court of appeal quashed that decision and ordered the lower court to deal with the merits of the case. 31.  during the hearing of 21 february 1995 the applicant unsuccessfully asked the court to release him on bail.  the relevant decision was upheld on appeal on 10 march 1995. subsequently, on 13 and 20 april 1995 and on a further unknown date, the applicant made similar applications. they all were dismissed on 15 may 1995 at first instance and, on appeal, on 22 june 1995. 32.  on 6 june 1995 the applicant again asked the pozna\u0144 regional court to release him on bail in view of his family situation. he also submitted that the criminal proceedings against him were not progressing with the requisite expedience. on 1 june 1995 the court dismissed the application on the ground that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question acting in an organised group. it attached considerable importance to the fact that the applicant had attempted to obtain a very substantial loan by false pretences. the court acknowledged, however, that his detention, which at the material time had exceeded eighteen months, had lasted for a long time. yet in the court\u2019s opinion, that fact did not in itself change the reasons given to justify his being held in custody. the applicant appealed against that decision. the appeal was dismissed on 11 july 1995. 33.  on 24 july 1995 the pozna\u0144 regional court dismissed another application for release made by the applicant on 11 july 1995. that decision was upheld on appeal on 10 august 1995. 34.  on 25 august 1995 the court held a hearing. the court did not deal with the merits of the case and adjourned the trial to 15 december 1995.\nduring that hearing the applicant and one of his co-defendants asked for release. the court released the applicant and his co-defendant with a condition that they submit to police supervision and ordered the applicant to surrender his passport. the court further observed that at the material time the length of their detention was nearly two years and that it was not desirable to hold them in custody, especially as the proceedings had to be adjourned for several months. the court found that there was no risk of collusion and that police supervision would be sufficient to secure the proper conduct of the trial. on 8 september 1995, on the pozna\u0144 regional prosecutor\u2019s appeal, the pozna\u0144 court of appeal upheld the first-instance decision and the reasons given for it. 35.  later, the court listed two hearings for 4 january and 11 march 1996. those hearings were cancelled; the first as one of the defence lawyers had failed to appear, the second because another defence lawyer asked the court to give him extra time to study documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution. 36.  on 9 april 1996 the trial court held the first hearing on the merits. on 13 and 14 june 1996 the trial continued. the court heard evidence from several witnesses called by the prosecution. 37.  the next hearing was listed for 19 august 1996 but subsequently cancelled since certain lay and expert witnesses had failed to appear. during the hearing of 23 october 1996 the court heard evidence from one witness. on 9 december 1996 the court heard evidence from three witnesses called by the defence and adjourned the trial because several other witnesses had failed to appear.  the court fined those witnesses, considering that they had not supplied any satisfactory explanation to justify their absence. the next hearing was listed for 23 january 1997; during that hearing the court heard evidence from one witness and ordered that evidence from experts be heard at the next hearing, scheduled for march. 38.  on 27 march 1997 the court did not hear evidence from experts because one of them had in the meantime died. for that reason, the trial was adjourned sine die. at that hearing, the court lifted the order to surrender the applicant\u2019s passport. it considered that it could not be said that in the course of the trial the applicant had obstructed its conduct and held that at the current stage of the proceedings there was no danger of his absconding or attempting to tamper with the process of obtaining evidence. 39.  on 9 september 1997 the applicant, maintaining that no hearing on the merits had been held in his case since 23 january 1997, complained to the ombudsman (rzecznik praw obywatelskich) about the length of the proceedings and asked him to intervene on his behalf. 40.  the applicant\u2019s trial was to restart on 4 december 1997 but was postponed to 29 december 1997 because the presiding judge was ill. on the latter date the court adjourned the trial since one of the co-defendants had failed to appear. during the hearing of 9 february 1998 the court heard evidence from an expert and one witness but adjourned the trial to 9 march 1998. on that day the court once again adjourned the trial because a witness had been absent. 41.  on 6 april 1998 the court held a hearing and heard evidence from one witness. it then postponed the trial to 20 may 1998. on the latter date it adjourned the trial sine die, considering that evidence from an expert in international banking transactions needed to be obtained. the trial court did, however, encounter certain difficulties in finding a suitable expert. eventually, in october 1998, the presiding judge appointed a.j., who assured the court that he would prepare the relevant report by the end of november 1998. yet as that report was in effect submitted to the court\u2019s registry on 1 december 1998 and the expert could not appear before the court at a hearing listed for 26 november 1998, the court postponed the trial to 7 december 1998. 42.  on the above-mentioned date the trial was adjourned to 11 january 1999 because r.b., one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants, had not appeared before the court. the police informed the court that r.b. had apparently left poland together with his family. 43.  on 11 january 1999 the regional prosecutor asked the court to severe the charges against r.b. and to proceed with the trial. the court made an order to that effect and, at the same hearing, heard evidence from an expert. 44.  the next hearing was listed for 1 february 1999. at that hearing, the applicant produced certain documents from the year 1995 and asked the court to obtain evidence from an expert in graphology. the court granted his application and appointed the expert on 9 april 1999, instructing him to prepare the report by the end of that month.\nthe report was submitted to the court\u2019s registry on 10 may 1999. 45.  after obtaining the report and serving its copies on the parties, the regional court (s\u0105d okr\u0119gowy) set the date for the parties\u2019 final submissions for 21 june 1999. on 28 june 1999 it gave judgment. the applicant was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment. all parties to the proceedings except for one of the applicant\u2019s co-defendants appealed. 46.  the pozna\u0144 court of appeal heard appeals on 17 february 2000. it quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case. the regional court listed the retrial for 7 july 2000 but the hearing was subsequently cancelled. the proceedings are still pending in the pozna\u0144 regional court.\nin a letter of 4 september 2001, the applicant informed the court that since 7 july 2000 the trial court had held hearings at six-month intervals and had so far heard evidence from four witnesses.", "labels": ["5",

{"text": "7.  in 1947 roman potocki, acting on behalf of his brother j\u00f3zef, lodged an application under article 7 of the decree of 26 october 1945 on real property in warsaw for temporary ownership of two plots of land located in krakowskie przedmie\u015bcie street, warsaw, to be awarded to j\u00f3zef potocki, the former owner. this application remained unanswered. 8.  on 3 december 1990 the warsaw district court declared that the estate of j\u00f3zef potocki had been inherited, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the polish civil code, by his wife pelagia-maria potocka for four sixteenths, and by each of his children, piotr potocki-radziwi\u0142\u0142, anna potocka, dorota potocka-radziwi\u0142\u0142 and izabela d\u2019ornano, for three sixteenths. 9.  on 20 december 1990 the second applicant lodged a request with the governor of warsaw for restitution of the two plots, indicating that they were listed in the warsaw land register under nos. 415 and 9048. 10.  by a decision of 5 august 1991 the director of the warsaw district office discontinued the administrative proceedings relating to the applicants\u2019 request of 20 december 1990. 11.  on 8 september 1991 the warsaw regional office quashed the decision to discontinue the proceedings. it stated that it had been established during the proceedings that the plots concerned were situated in warsaw. by virtue of the decree on real property in warsaw of 26 october 1945, all real property situated in warsaw had been expropriated. however, under article 7 of that decree, former owners had a right to lodge an application for temporary ownership of their plots. the authorities competent to deal with these applications could award temporary ownership if it was established that the plots concerned had not been designated for public use and that the award would not be incompatible with such use. in the applicants\u2019 case, such an application had been lodged in 1947, but it had remained unanswered. the first-instance administrative authority, when dealing with the applicants\u2019 request of 20 december 1990, had overlooked that fact. when reconsidering the case, that authority was required, in particular, to examine whether granting the applicants the right to perpetual use of the plot under the land administration and expropriation act of 1985, the provisions of which had replaced the procedural rights afforded to former real-property owners by article 7 of the 1945 decree, would conflict with the public use of the plots concerned, as determined in relevant local land-development plans. 12.  on 27 december 1991 the director of the warsaw district office refused to return the plots to the applicants and to grant them the right to their perpetual use. he stated that it had been established during the proceedings that in 1947 the applicants\u2019 predecessor in title had submitted an application for temporary ownership of the plots, which had then been listed in the warsaw land register under entries nos. 415 and 9048. this application had remained unanswered, but the administrative authority had duly examined it in the course of the current proceedings. it was established that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at 70 to 75% during the second world war, as was pointed out in a letter of the regional conservator of historical monuments of 28 november 1991. the palace had subsequently been rebuilt by the ministry of culture. thus it had been the state treasury which had borne the costs of rebuilding the palace. accordingly, restitution of the property concerned would have been unjustified, and the administrative authority found no grounds on which the 1947 application and the request lodged by the applicants in 1990 should be granted. 13.  the applicants lodged an appeal against that decision. they argued that the decision was not in conformity with the applicable laws, in particular as the first-instance authority had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the palace had indeed been destroyed during the second world war. they also complained that no sound arguments had been advanced in the decision to show that restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its public use. 14.  on 27 february 1992 the governor\u2019s office rejected the applicants\u2019 appeal, finding that it had been lodged one day after the expiration of the fourteen-day time-limit provided for in the code of administrative procedure. 15.  the applicants filed an appeal with the supreme administrative court. they argued that the appeal had been posted on 20 january 1992, that is on the last day of the time-limit, as was shown by a post-office receipt. the fact that the postmark on the envelope was dated 21 january 1992 was due exclusively to the incomprehensible negligence of the postal services and could not be held against the applicants. 16.  on 24 july 1992 the supreme administrative court quashed the decision appealed against, considering that it was not established that the applicants had lodged their appeal against the decision of 27 december 1991 outside the time-limit provided for by the code of administrative procedure, in particular because the applicants had submitted the post-office receipt to the court, showing clearly that their appeal had been posted on 20 january 1992. 17.  on 9 september 1993 the office of the governor of warsaw, having examined the applicants\u2019 appeal of 20 january 1992, upheld the decision of 27 december 1991. it pointed out that the administrative authority had established that the property of the applicants\u2019 predecessor-in-title had been designated by relevant land-development plans adopted in 1947, 1983 and 1992 for use by the ministry of culture and arts. that designation had not been changed by any subsequent decision, as was certified by a letter of 19 august 1993 from the director of the land administration department of the warsaw district office. the governor further held that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at 70 to 75% during the second world war, as was certified by a letter of the regional conservator of historical monuments of 28 november 1991. the palace had been rebuilt in the late 1940s by the ministry of culture and arts. as it had been the state treasury that had borne the rebuilding costs, it had acquired ownership of the property concerned. moreover, at the time when roman potocki had lodged the application for temporary ownership, the buildings on the plot had not existed, as they had been destroyed. the administrative authority concluded that, in the light of the above considerations, granting the applicants the right to perpetual use would be unjustified. 18.  on 12 october 1993 the applicants lodged an appeal with the supreme administrative court against that judgment, complaining that the impugned decision was not in conformity with applicable substantive law. they first submitted that the decision was in breach of article 7 of the 1945 decree in that the administrative authorities had failed to establish with sufficient clarity that the applicants\u2019 intentions as to the future use of the palace had not been compatible with the local land-development plan. the applicants emphasised that the authorities had disregarded their argument that they did not plan to alter the public nature of the palace. they had only wanted to reserve a small part of it for their exclusive use, whereas the remainder would be used for cultural and leisure purposes and would be accessible to the general public. therefore, no issue arose, in fact, regarding the designation of the property for public use as its use was to remain unchanged. moreover, the authorities had failed to indicate why the restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its continued public use. 19.  the applicants further stressed that the authorities had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the buildings on the plots had been destroyed during the second world war and subsequently rebuilt by the state, and that they should therefore be considered the state\u2019s property. the findings made in this respect were superficial and based on insufficient evidence. the applicants emphasised in particular that the letter from the regional conservator of historical monuments of 28 november 1991 could not reasonably be regarded as credible, as the conservator operated under the supervision of the ministry of culture and thus could not be expected to act against the ministry\u2019s interests. in view of that flaw, the authorities should have requested a report by an expert on construction technology in order to verify the information in the conservator\u2019s letter. in conclusion, the applicants requested that the decision under appeal should be set aside and that the case should be re-examined. 20.  the applicants submitted that articles 7, 8, 10, 12, 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, 75 \u00a7 1, 77 \u00a7 1, 78 \u00a7 1 and 107 \u00a7 3 of the code of administrative procedure had been breached in the course of the proceedings and that those procedural shortcomings had had a bearing on the outcome of the case. 21.  on an unspecified date a hearing was held before the supreme administrative court in the appeal proceedings. the applicants\u2019 lawyer submitted that their application of 20 december 1990 was to be seen both as a reiterated application for temporary ownership, lodged in 1947, and as a new application for restitution of the property concerned and for having a right to perpetual use of the land awarded. 22.  by a judgment of 22 june 1995 the supreme administrative court rejected the applicants\u2019 appeal in so far as it concerned the application for temporary ownership, which had been submitted by roman potocki in 1947. in doing so, the court recalled that, pursuant to article 14 of the supreme administrative court act of 31 january 1980, as amended, it was not competent to deal with appeals against administrative decisions given in cases in which proceedings had been instituted before 1 september 1980. accordingly, the court could not review the lawfulness of that part of the contested second-instance administrative decision, given that the relevant proceedings had been instituted in 1947. 23.  in so far as the decision under appeal concerned the applicants\u2019 application of 20 december 1990 for restitution of their former property and for the right to perpetual use of the land under the provisions of the land administration and expropriation act of 1985, the supreme administrative court first considered that the authorities had failed to show why restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with public use of the plot and the palace, and had therefore breached article 107 \u00a7 3 of the code of administrative procedure, under which an administrative authority, when issuing a decision, was required to point out the facts on which it had relied, to refer to evidence which had served as a basis for its factual findings, and to indicate the grounds on which other evidence had not been considered credible.\nthe court further considered that despite those procedural shortcomings the decision under appeal had, in any event, been lawful. the court noted that the crux of that part of the case was to assess whether the applicants could, under the land administration and expropriation act of 1985, claim to have a right to perpetual use of the plots concerned conferred on them by way of compensation for the expropriation carried out under the 1945 decree. \nthe court observed that under section 82(2) of the land administration and expropriation act, a right to perpetual use of land could only be conferred in cases where real property was given back to its former owners. however, that entitlement had been limited to certain categories of real property, namely one-family houses or small apartment blocks. the property concerned in the present case did not belong to any of those categories. moreover, the 1985 act had laid down a time-limit for the submission of such claims, and that limit had expired on 31 december 1988. the applicants\u2019 application of 20 december 1990 to have their former property restored to them and for the right to perpetual use of the property had been lodged outside that time-limit. accordingly, the restitution could not have been ordered. the supreme administrative court therefore dismissed the remainder of the applicants\u2019 appeal.", "labels": ["5", "6"]}
{"text": "9.  the applicant is an iranian national and was born in 1971. his present address is unknown. 10.  he entered germany in october 1997 after fleeing iran and applied for political-refugee status. 11.  at a hearing on 16 october 1997 at the federal office for refugees (bundesamt f\u00fcr die anerkennung ausl\u00e4ndischer fl\u00fcchtlinge), the applicant gave evidence that one of his sisters had been executed in iran in 1982 or 1983, while another had been imprisoned from 10 january 1983 to 13 september 1984 and had been missing since 1987 or 1988. he had raised funds in iran and taken notes during radio programmes which he had subsequently added to and circulated. he had decided to leave iran on learning from third parties that the family home had been searched on 6 september 1997.\nthe verbatim record taken by the federal office for refugees indicates that the applicant had produced a list of the martyrs of the people\u2019s mujahidin organisation of iran (an opposition movement in iran), which included his first sister, and a certificate from the sari islamic revolutionary court of 31 december 1984 indicating that his second sister had been arrested and imprisoned from 10 january 1983 to 11 september 1984 on account of her activities for the monafeghin. 12.  in a decision of 31 august 1998 the federal office for refugees dismissed his application on the ground that there was no bar to his expulsion under section 51 or 53 of the aliens act (ausl\u00e4ndergesetz \u2013 see \u201crelevant domestic law\u201d below), since he had not succeeded in establishing that he risked persecution if he returned to iran. the federal office found his account vague and parts of it self-contradictory; it also considered it strange that it had not been until several years after the persecution of his sisters that he had become involved in activities against the regime. 13.  on 5 november 1998 a group of iranian political refugees sent a letter to the federal office for refugees stating that the applicant was a supporter of the people\u2019s mujahidin of iran and a member of a family of \u201cmartyrs\u201d in iran that was under threat from the incumbent regime, one of his sisters having been arrested, tortured and executed in the 1980s. 14.  at a hearing on 10 november 1998 in the regensburg administrative court (verwaltungsgericht) the applicant asked for mr yaghoubinia, his brother-in-law, who has political-refugee status in switzerland, to be called as a witness. the court, however, turned his request down. 15.  on 11 november 1998 the regensburg administrative court upheld the decision of the federal office for refugees. on 15 december 1998 the bavarian administrative court of appeal (bayerischer verwaltungs-gerichshof) dismissed a further appeal by the applicant. 16.  on 2 march 1999 the applicant made a fresh application for asylum (asylfolgeantrag), inter alia, on the ground that he had been interviewed by the offener kanal dortmund television channel at a demonstration outside the iranian embassy in bonn on 9 january 1999 and had signed a resolution against the iranian regime that had been published in an opposition newspaper in iran on 2 february 1999. 17.  on 28 april 1999 the federal office for refugees dismissed that application, finding that the new evidence was insufficient to establish that the applicant would face political persecution if he returned to iran. 18.  on 25 may and 23 june 1999 the applicant appealed against that decision and applied for a stay of execution of the expulsion order, inter alia, on the ground that he had taken part in a demonstration against iran on 20 june 1999 at the g8 summit in cologne and had been filmed by simaye moghavemat, the mujahidin people\u2019s television station based in london. 19.  on 25 june 1999 mrs hajar yaghoubinia-kalantari, the applicant\u2019s sister, who has political-refugee status in switzerland and represented the applicant in the proceedings in the court, sent a letter to the german consulate in geneva stating that she and her husband had been political prisoners in iran, that her sister had been executed by the iranian regime and that a law had been passed by the iranian parliament making it an offence to engage in any political activity against the regime abroad. she sent a copy of that letter to various international organisations such as the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), the united nations high commission for human rights, amnesty international\u2019s berne office and the european court of human rights. 20.  on the same day the regensburg administrative court requested information from the german ministry of foreign affairs about the risk the applicant would face as a signatory of the resolution against the iranian regime in the event of his expulsion to iran. 21.  on 8 july 1999 the omct (world organisation against torture) contacted the permanent mission of germany to the united nations in order to apprise germany of the risks the applicant would face if expelled to iran. 22.  in a first judgment of 21 july 1999 the regensburg administrative court ordered a stay of the expulsion order, holding that the federal office for refugees should have taken the applicant\u2019s open criticism of the iranian regime into account and that it would not be possible to decide the case until the information requested from the ministry of foreign affairs had been received. 23.  in a second judgment delivered on 23 july 1999 the administrative court reversed that decision when a sworn statement adduced by the applicant of the person who had interviewed him at the demonstration and had identified himself as the editor of the offener kanal dortmund television channel turned out to be false, as the director of that television channel had said in evidence that the person concerned had never worked for the channel. as a result, the administrative court concluded that the grounds relied on by the applicant following his flight (nachfluchtgr\u00fcnde) were a total fabrication. 24.  however, on 27 july 1999 the director of offener kanal dortmund sent a letter to the administrative court admitting that he had made a mistake and that, while the person who had interviewed the applicant was not the editor of the channel, he had reported for it on a regular basis. 25.  notwithstanding these developments and the fact that it had yet to receive information from the ministry of foreign affairs, the regensburg administrative court dismissed the applicant\u2019s application for a stay of execution of the expulsion order in judgments delivered on 27 july, and 5 and 10 august 1999, holding that he had not succeeded in establishing that he would face political persecution if he returned to his country. in particular, the resolution against the iranian regime that had been signed by the applicant and published in an opposition newspaper in iran on 2 february 1999 and in which he had declared himself to be a supporter of the people\u2019s mujahidin of iran, did not suffice to establish a risk of persecution, as it had been signed by 1,500 iranians living in exile. nor did the mere fact that the applicant\u2019s name had been mentioned in a television programme broadcast on a private channel on 12 january 1999, or that he had been filmed at a demonstration against the iranian regime in bonn suffice. the same was also true of the applicant\u2019s participation in a demonstration outside the iranian embassy during the g8 summit in cologne on 20 june 1999, as it had been attended by the majority of iranian asylum-seekers living in germany. 26.  on 6 august 1999, on being informed by the applicant\u2019s family that the applicant\u2019s expulsion was imminent, the special rapporteur on torture of the united nations high commission for human rights launched an urgent appeal to prevent the applicant\u2019s deportation to iran. 27.  on 9 august 1999 the applicant made a further application to the regensburg administrative court for a stay of execution of the expulsion order. he enclosed the swiss authorities\u2019 decision of 16 january 1989 granting mrs hajar yaghoubinia-kalantari, his sister, political asylum and an article from the 29 june 1999 edition of the modjahed newspaper reporting the execution of his other sister, ms masoumeh kalantari. 28.  in a decision of 10 august 1999 the federal constitutional court (bundesverfassungsgericht), sitting as a bench of three members, declined to accept a constitutional appeal by the applicant for adjudication. 29.  the substantive proceedings are still pending in the regensburg administrative court, but have no suspensive effect. 30.  initially, the applicant attempted to flee to france and then on to switzerland, where he was stopped at the border and sent back to france, where he is probably in hiding. 31.  the applicant also made an application to the swiss consulate in lyons for political asylum in switzerland, but the federal office for refugees dismissed his application on 29 october 1999 and refused him permission to enter swiss territory. the swiss asylum appeals board, before which the case is pending, issued a provisional opinion on 10 november 1999 opposing a grant of asylum. 32.  on 24 september 1999 the applicant asked the european court of human rights to intervene as a matter of urgency in order to prevent his expulsion to iran, saying that he faced imprisonment and torture there. 33.  on 27 september 1999 the president of the fourth section decided not to apply rule 39 of the rules of court. 34.  on 13 december 1999 the applicant made a further application to the court under rule 39 in which he relied on new evidence. 35.  this consisted of two letters: a letter of 8 july 1999 from the omct to the german authorities and a letter of 22 october 1999 from the unhcr liaison office for switzerland and liechtenstein to the swiss authorities. both letters said that the applicant was at risk of persecution if expelled to iran. they added that one of the applicant\u2019s sisters had been executed, while another sister and her husband had been arrested and tortured in iran before managing to escape and obtain political-refugee status in switzerland. 36.  in its letter of 8 july 1999 the omct said that, according to the information in its possession, the applicant \u201chad been forced to flee his country of origin, as his life was in danger there. his sister and her husband had already left the islamic republic of iran some years earlier, after being arrested and tortured; his other sister had been executed by the incumbent regime\u201d. 37.  in its letter of 22 october 1999 the unhcr liaison office for switzerland and liechtenstein expressed the opinion that \u201cthe applicant may be in danger if he is sent back to his country of origin, since it appears that his participation in a demonstration against the government was filmed and broadcast in a television programme that can also be received in iran. further, the petition signed by the applicant and the names of the signatories to it have been published in an opposition newspaper. these details could thus lead the iranian government to identify the applicant as an opponent, especially in view of the active political role his two sisters have played in the past\u201d. 38.  in a letter of 20 december 1999 the government was informed pursuant to rule 40 of the rules of court that the applicant had made a request to the court for the application of rule 39. 39.  on 6 january 2000 a chamber composed of judges from the fourth section decided to apply rule 39 and to request the government not to expel the applicant before 6 april 2000. it invited the parties to provide further details on the persecution of the other members of the applicant\u2019s family in iran and the reasons for such persecution, together with copies of the swiss authorities\u2019 decisions relating to the grant of political asylum to the applicant\u2019s sister and her husband in switzerland. 40.  on 25 january 2000 the government informed the court that they were not in a position to furnish the information requested. 41.  on 29 january and 28 february 2000 the applicant\u2019s sister provided, inter alia, the following information to the court:\n\u201cmy sister mina (massoumeh) kalantari was arrested for her political activities and, after being subjected to torture over several months, executed (she died under torture) ... both my husband and i were political prisoners and tortured in common with all other opponents of the iranian regime who have been to prison ... i spent a long time in an isolated cell and from time to time heard the cries of other prisoners being tortured, even at night ... this is but the briefest of summaries of our prison ordeal ... it is for this reason that we fled iran ...\u201d 42.  she also described the persecution of the other members of her family in iran, her other sister zara (khadijeh) kalantari, her brother mohammad raza kalantari and her mother effat kalantari. 43.  she enclosed copies of the following documents:\n(i)  a decision, in persian and french, of the sari islamic revolutionary court dated 31 december 1984 accusing her of being a member of the \u201corganisation of hypocrites\u201d (the organisation of the mujahidin) and of engaging in activities as part of that organisation, as a result of which she had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment from 10 january 1983 to 11 september 1984; \n(ii)  a decision dated 25 june 1987 of the person responsible for supervising the execution of that court\u2019s judgments certifying that her husband was also a member of that organisation and had served a 22-month prison sentence on that account;\n(iii)  an extract from the 29 june 1999 edition of the opposition newspaper modjahed reporting the martyrdom of her sister massoumeh kalantari;\n(iv)  documents attesting to her and her husband\u2019s political activities in switzerland (such as attending demonstrations against the iranian regime);\n(v)  a letter of 16 january 1989 from the swiss commissioner for refugees informing her and her husband of the swiss decision to grant her asylum (without giving reasons);\n(vi)  a letter from the head of the unhcr liaison office for switzerland and liechtenstein dated 24 february 2000, attesting to the fact that by reason of their political activities as members of the pmoi (people\u2019s mujahidin organisation of iran), mr and mrs yaghoubinia (the applicant\u2019s brother-in-law and sister) had been \u201cseverely beaten and tortured and sentenced to respectively five years\u2019 and one year\u2019s imprisonment. mr yaghoubinia was released on 6 november 1984 on health grounds (heart problems), shortly after his wife\u2019s release on 13 september 1984\u201d. it added that mr and mrs yaghoubinia had fled iran and travelled to turkey after the iranian government had launched a vast operation for the interrogation of former political prisoners and they had been questioned by security forces. the letter said, in its conclusion:\n\u201cafter examining their application for refugee status, the eligibility officer accorded them refugee status on 10 november 1987 under the hcr mandate under article 6 paragraph a(ii) of the statute of the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees of 14 december 1950.\nin view of the geographical reservation issued by turkey when it ratified the geneva convention relating to the status of refugees of 28 july 1951, the hcr has attempted to find a country where mr and mrs yaghoubinia will be able to resettle. by a letter of 17 june 1988, the commissioner for refugees of the swiss confederation informed the hcr that it would accept these refugees in switzerland as part of its quota policy.\u201d 44.  on 1 march 2000 the assistant to the special rapporteur on torture at the united nation\u2019s high commission on human rights sent the court the following extract from a report of the special rapporteur on torture, which was made public at the beginning of april 2000:\n\u201con 6 august 1999 the special rapporteur sent an urgent appeal on behalf of ali reza kalantari, an iranian national who was reportedly facing imminent and forcible repatriation to iran on 10 august 1999 from flughafen frankfurt on lufthansa, iran where he may be at risk of torture. his applications for refugee status were reportedly rejected by the german authorities and he was forced to sign a document from the iranian consulate in munich agreeing to return to iran. he was reportedly arrested by the police in k\u00f6ln on 20 june 1999 while he was protesting against the iranian government.\u201d 45.  in a letter of 18 june 2001 the government informed the court that, by a decision of 15 june 2001, the federal office for refugees had set aside its decision of 31 august 1998 (see paragraph 12 above) on the ground that a bar existed, within the meaning of section 53(4) of the aliens act (see \u201crelevant domestic law\u201d \u2013

{"text": "8.  the applicant is a german national, born in 1938 and living in mettmann. 9.  in a letter of 30 december 1985 addressed to the rheinprovinz pension office (landesversicherungsanstalt), the applicant and her husband, born in 1927, declared that for the purposes of entitlement to a widow\u2019s or a widower\u2019s pension the statutory rules still in force should continue to apply in future (see below, \u201crelevant domestic law\u201d). 10.  on 4 march 1986, following her husband\u2019s death, the applicant applied with the rheinprovinz insurance office for the payment of a survivor\u2019s pension. 11.  on 10 june 1986 the insurance office issued a decision granting the applicant a survivor\u2019s pension as from 1 march 1986. the office, referring to the relevant provision of the workers\u2019 pension (reform) act, further stated that in case that the person concerned had other earned income or income in lieu of earned income, the payment of the survivor\u2019s pension was not suspended during the first year after the spouse\u2019s death. during the second year, the survivor\u2019s pension was reduced by a specific percentage in relation to a dynamic exonerated amount. 12.  on 20 june 1986 the applicant lodged an administrative complaint (widerspruch) with the pensions office, which was dismissed on 24 march 1987. 13.  by submissions dated 27 april 1987, the applicant, represented by counsel, instituted proceedings with the d\u00fcsseldorf social court, challenging the above decisions issued by the rheinprovinz pension office. she maintained in particular that the underlying legislation, especially the age-limit for opting out of the new system, was unconstitutional, i.e. in breach of the right to property. in this respect, the applicant noted that, according to information provided by the federal ministry for labour and social matters, a constitutional complaint concerning the above issue was pending before the federal constitutional court. she suggested that the proceedings before the social court be suspended to await the outcome of the said constitutional complaint proceedings. with her action, the applicant also objected to the calculation of the pension in question. 14.  on 24 june 1987 the d\u00fcsseldorf social court suspended the proceedings pursuant to section 251 of the code of civil procedure (zivilprozessordnung - see below, relevant domestic law). 15.  on 14 august 1987 the rheinprovinz pensions office reassessed the applicant\u2019s survivor\u2019s pension. taking her other income into account, the office suspended the monthly payment of dem 967.10. 16.  by submissions of 10 september 1987, the applicant filed an action with the d\u00fcsseldorf social court against the decision of 14 august 1987. she again suggested that the proceedings be suspended pending constitutional complaint proceedings in a similar case. the second set of proceedings was, thereupon, also suspended. 17.  on 26 february 1993 the applicant requested the social court to resume the suspended proceedings. she noted that in the meantime the federal constitutional court had not taken any decisions concerning the legal provision at issue in her case. on 17 march 1993 the social court informed the applicant that the proceedings had been resumed. 18.  on 22 july 1993 the social court inquired with the federal constitutional court about the state of the constitutional complaint proceedings concerning certain aspects of the reform of the rules governing a survivor\u2019s pension. on 5 august 1993 the federal constitutional court informed the social court that two proceedings had terminated in 1987 and that it envisaged rendering a decision in three further cases in 1994. 19.  on 17 september 1993 the social court held an oral hearing. following discussion, the parties agreed to a further suspension of the proceedings. 20.  on 5 june 1996 the applicant requested the social court to resume the proceedings. she submitted that, having regard to the length of the proceedings before the federal constitutional court and considering her age, she could no longer be expected to wait. on 18 june 1996 the social court informed the applicant that the proceedings had been resumed. on 5 february 1998 the social court inquired again with the federal constitutional court about the state of proceedings before it. 21.  on 18 february 1998 the federal constitutional court dismissed two constitutional complaints. it found that the rules introduced by the survivor\u2019s pension and educational periods act, in so far as they provided for a suspension of the payment of the survivor\u2019s pension in case of other earned income or income in lieu of earned income, were compatible with the basic law (grundgesetz). 22.  on 7 may 1998 the social court forwarded the federal constitutional court\u2019s decision to the applicant\u2019s counsel and requested him for comments. after a reminder, the applicant\u2019s counsel asked for an extension of the time limit. after a further reminder, the applicant\u2019s counsel informed the social court on 13 october 1998 that he was no longer representing the applicant. 23.  on 17 march 1999 the social court dismissed the applicants\u2019 actions. it found in particular that in 1987 the federal constitutional court had declared the age-limit of 50 years compatible with the basic law. it held that the federal constitutional court\u2019s decisions of 1998 had no impact on its decision, as they did not concern the issues raised in the applicant\u2019s action.", "labels": ["6"]}
{"text": "8.  the applicant was arrested in the early morning of 21 october 1990 under section 14 of the prevention of terrorism (temporary provisions) act 1989 in strabane by police officers of the royal ulster constabulary (\u201cthe ruc\u201d) investigating the murder of a former member of the ulster defence regiment. the applicant was transported to the special holding centre for terrorist investigations at castlereagh, belfast. 9.  the applicant was interviewed for thirty-five hours on consecutive days by ruc police officers, beginning at 11.01 a.m. on 21 october until 25 october. 10.  at the time when the applicant was arrested (1.50 a.m. on 21 october), there was an initial decision made to defer the applicant\u2019s access to a solicitor by superintendent m., the police officer in charge of the investigation. he communicated this decision to castlereagh police station by telephone and confirmed this in writing when he arrived in castlereagh. the applicant had by this time arrived in castlereagh and had requested a solicitor. at a review at 9.15 p.m. on 21 october 1990, the applicant was informed that his right to see a solicitor had been delayed for twenty-four hours. the deferral was therefore effective until the morning of 22 october. his solicitor, mr fahy, was informed of the deferral but did not attend until 12.10 p.m. on 23 october. there was a period of time from early morning on 22 october when the applicant was not being denied access to his solicitor. he made relevant admissions that afternoon. 11.  the applicant did not see his solicitor until the next day, namely 23 october. the applicant\u2019s first interview with his solicitor lasted forty minutes until 12.50 p.m. and the applicant made no complaint of ill-treatment during that visit. the applicant saw his solicitor again at 3.15 p.m. on 25 october and again no complaint of ill-treatment was made in that interview, which lasted until 4.00 p.m. during the first interview with his solicitor, a policeman was present. the consultation took place within sight and hearing of the police officer who was in close proximity to the applicant and his solicitor. at the beginning of the interview, the police inspector told the solicitor in the presence of the applicant that no names were to be discussed or information conveyed which could assist other suspects and that the interview should be purely on legal advice. 12.  the applicant was seen by doctors on a total of eight occasions during his stay in castlereagh, beginning with an examination following his arrival in castlereagh in the early morning of 21 october 1990. he made no complaint of ill-treatment to any of the doctors who examined him. the doctors found no evidence to indicate any ill-treatment or mental handicap. 13.  the police alleged that the applicant admitted his involvement in the murder during an interview in the afternoon of 22 october. they further stated that in a later interview the applicant signed a statement to this effect and that thereafter he freely and voluntarily admitted additional terrorist activity and signed further statements. 14.  the applicant alleged that he had not volunteered the statements freely but, instead, that all the verbal and written statements had been extracted by ill-treatment, threats of ill-treatment, threats to his family and other oppressive conduct. the allegations of ill-treatment were denied by the ruc. 15.  all of the verbal and written statements made by the applicant had been obtained by the police officers after the administration by them of cautions pursuant to article 3 of the criminal evidence (northern ireland) order 1988, in the following terms:\n\u201cyou do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but i must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court, your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you. if you do wish to say anything, what you say may be given in evidence.\u201d 16.  the applicant\u2019s solicitor was never permitted to be present at any of the applicant\u2019s interviews, nor was any independent person; nor were the interviews recorded on video or audiotape. 17.  on 25 october 1990, at 7.30 p.m., the applicant was transferred from castlereagh to strandtown ruc station, where he was charged. 18.  on 14 october 1993 the applicant was tried by a single judge, mccollum j, sitting without a jury, for a total of eighteen serious offences including, inter alia, murder, attempted murder, possession of firearms and ammunition with intent, possession of explosives with intent, false imprisonment, hijacking a motor vehicle, and membership of a proscribed organisation, namely the provisional irish republican army (the \u201cira\u201d). he was found guilty on all counts. 19.  the disputed verbal and written statements by the applicant constituted the only evidence connecting the applicant to the charges brought. the admissibility of the statements was challenged by the applicant on the basis that they had been obtained by torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or, alternatively, should be excluded in exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion. a voir dire (submission on a point of law in the absence of the jury) commenced and the applicant gave evidence over ten days which consisted of a highly detailed account of ill-treatment which he alleged he had experienced from the police. the officers denied ill-treating the applicant. 20.  the events in the interviews had been filmed by television camera and the pictures relayed to a monitor screen in a special room at castlereagh police station. at all times, an officer of the rank of inspector was on duty for the purpose of viewing the monitor screens. a number of officers gave evidence and all of them told the court that they had seen no evidence of impropriety of any kind occurring during the interviews with the applicant. indeed, none of them had ever witnessed an example of bad behaviour by an interviewing officer. 21.  the doctors, who examined the applicant a number of times in castlereagh, gave evidence that the applicant had been cooperative and composed, that there were no signs of recent injuries and that the applicant did not complain of ill-treatment. treatment had been given to the applicant in respect of his history of duodenal ulceration. 22.  the applicant\u2019s account of the interrogation was rejected by the trial judge, who said:\n\u201chaving heard the officers concerned who impressed me as being honest and conscientious officers, i am absolutely convinced that all of [the applicant\u2019s] allegations of ill-treatment at this stage are completely unfounded ...\nin my view if there had been any truth in the account of ill-treatment given by [the applicant] his distress would have been obvious to the doctors ... none of the medical evidence therefore gave any credence to the account given by [the applicant] in the witness box and all of that evidence is consistent with his being treated with absolute propriety ... \n... i am satisfied ... that in no respect was [the applicant] subjected to any treatment which could be described as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, violence or oppression in order to induce a confession from him. i am satisfied that he was not threatened in any way.\u201d 23.  at the trial, there was unchallenged independent medical evidence to the effect that: 24.  evidence was given later in the trial by a psychologist that\n\u201c[the applicant] is a psychologically vulnerable man and in my view would have required appropriate support in the context of police interviews. [the applicant\u2019s] psychological vulnerabilities taken together with the lack of support from either the solicitor or an appropriate adult during the police interviews and the prolonged and intensive nature of the interviews would in my opinion be of relevance to the reliability of his admissions\u201d. 25.  in convicting the applicant, the judge rejected this evidence, finding that the applicant had not needed any form of independent support during the interviews and the police had been entitled to treat him as an ordinary member of society. he noted that the applicant\u2019s earliest admissions did not follow particularly prolonged or intensive questioning and that during those interviews he persisted with a consistent story told with an air of conviction. he also noted that no one thought to have the applicant\u2019s mental capacity investigated prior to the commencement of the trial. the trial judge stated:\n\u201c... i am satisfied that [the applicant] was not suffering from such a degree of mental handicap that would have required the police to exercise any special consideration for him and that his memory, understanding and intellect were quite adequate to enable him to resist making any false confession under questioning in castlereagh and that the questioning was, therefore, not in any respect unfair to him.\nif he was an easier subject than others or more manageable i do not consider that that would be a matter which throws any doubt on the admissibility of any statements of confessions made by him\u201d. 26.  the police questioning which led to his confessions was therefore not unfair and the judge had no doubt about the reliability of the admissions made by the applicant. 27.  in relation to the question of access to a solicitor, the judge observed that the deferral of twenty-four hours was effective until the morning of 22 october 1990. however, the applicant\u2019s solicitor did not arrive until 12.10 p.m. on 23 october. the trial judge noted that there had been a suggestion that the solicitor may have been unintentionally misled as to the length of time of the deferral but found, having heard the solicitor and police officers concerned, that he was satisfied that the solicitor was accurately informed that the deferral was for twenty-four hours. he further noted that it might well have been convenient for the solicitor to delay his visit to castlereagh until the next day because a number of other prisoners had had access deferred until then. in any event, it was not the deferral which prevented the applicant from seeing his solicitor after sometime early in the morning of 22 october but the fact that his solicitor did not arrive until 23 october. incriminating admissions were made by the applicant at a time when he was no longer being denied access to a solicitor. the judge concluded that there was nothing improper in the decision to deny access for twenty-four hours, having regard to the police fears that messages might be passed through the solicitor with a view to alerting others implicated in offences. 28.  the trial judge stated, inter alia:\n\u201chaving considered the extent of the strength of character of the accused, his intellectual shortcomings and his nature i am quite satisfied that he was not a person for whom the regime of questioning in castlereagh would of itself be oppressive ...\ni am further satisfied that nothing was said or done during his questioning the effect of which upon him would justify the exercise of a discretion to exclude the statement ...\ni am satisfied that ... his admissions were made freely, and accept the police evidence that what triggered the making of admissions by this accused was the fact that the police were able to demonstrate to him that they had information available to them which discredited the alibi that he had given them ...\nin my view the particular circumstances of this case provided ample grounds for the belief that other persons could be alerted if a solicitor had seen this accused within 24 hours. in any case [the applicant] made no admission during the 24 hours for which the solicitor had been deferred.\ni am satisfied that the deferral was right and proper in this case and that in any case it was not the deferral that resulted in the accused not seeing his solicitor during the early part of 22 october.\u201d 29.  the judge further considered the applicant\u2019s complaints that a police officer had been present during the first legal consultation with his solicitor and whether this had prevented him getting the full benefit of his solicitor\u2019s advice. evidence had been heard from the police inspector concerned who had stated that the purpose of sitting in to observe the interview was primarily to prevent information from being passed from the prisoner to the solicitor which might assist others suspected of involvement in the offence who had not yet been arrested. under cross-examination, he stated that he had not been told of any codes that might be used and that it would be hard to identify such a code if it was used. the judge found, on the evidence of the applicant, his solicitor and the police officer, that the solicitor had not been in the least inhibited by the presence of the police officers and, according to the applicant, had been quite prepared to raise the crucial evidential issues with him. he was satisfied that an objective state of affairs existed justifying both the initial deferral of access and the supervision of the interview, namely, two other suspects were still at large whom the police wished to interview. 30.  the judge concluded that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confessions were made freely and voluntarily. there was no ground for exercising his discretion to exclude any of the oral or written statements made by the applicant. the judge was accordingly satisfied that the applicant knew that he was playing a part in a murder plot and was therefore, inter alia, guilty of murder. 31.  the applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the court of appeal of northern ireland. the court of appeal noted that the inspector had authorised the postponement of access to a solicitor before the applicant had made a request for a solicitor, which was in technical breach of the statutory provision. the court of appeal noted that there was no express sanction for breach of that provision. however, there was nothing unfair to the applicant as the deferral ran from the time of the arrest whenever the authorisation was given. the court of appeal was satisfied that substantial reasons existed for the police to postpone access to a solicitor in this particular case pursuant to section 45(8)(b) and (e) of the northern ireland (emergency provisions) act 1991. in a judgment of 24 september 1996, the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal stating, inter alia:\n\u201cwe have no doubt that the learned trial judge was at all times aware of the need to bear the psychological evidence very much in mind when forming his conclusions both at the direction stage and when finally deciding if the crown had established [the applicant\u2019s] guilt beyond reasonable doubt ... \nwe are entirely satisfied that the learned trial judge was entitled to refuse the application for a direction [regarding inadmissibility] and to rule the various statements to be admissible ... equally our perusal of the evidence does not suggest that the learned judge should, in the exercise of his discretion have excluded the statements, or any of them, from evidence ...\nthis is an appeal in which the evidence was lengthy and detailed. we have carefully considered all the evidence and [the applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] closely reasoned submission. we have finally stood back from all the detail and looked at the case \u2018in the round\u2019 as [the applicant\u2019s counsel] invited us to do. we are satisfied that [the applicant\u2019s] guilt was fully established by his admission and that his convictions are neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory.\u201d 32.  on 28 july 1997 the applicant\u2019s petition seeking leave to appeal to the house of lords was dismissed.", "labels": ["6"]}
